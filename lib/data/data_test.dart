      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''“No,” Anara said, barely containing her fury as she shot to her feet. “Radu has given you the information you need. We will not ally with humans.”

  I stood in Radu Draculesti’s gilded drawing room opposite Anara, with Abraham Van Helsing and Jack Seward hovering behind me. Radu and my half-brother Gabriel were still seated, looking at us with quiet astonishment.

  I had just proposed to Radu that we work together to defeat the vampires who had abducted my fiancé, Jonathan Harker . . . vampires that happened to be his biological children. Vlad Draculesti and his sister Ilona were not only responsible for Jonathan’s abduction, but other abductions and murders occurring all around Europe as well. We needed to stop them, and the only way to do so was to work together.

  I was hardly surprised at Anara’s protest—she seemed to hate me the moment she laid eyes on me. Ignoring her protest, I kept my gaze trained firmly on Radu.

  “Anara, please,” Radu said, frowning at her. “If it were not for my cowardice . . . if I had just forced myself to kill Vlad years ago . . .”

  His voice trailed off, dipping with regret, but Anara interrupted him.

  “You told me we were done with this fight!”

  “I was in denial, my love. I have known that I would one day be forced to confront my children. It seems that day has come. I can no longer close my eyes to what is happening.”

  Anara vibrated with fury, but she turned and vanished from the room in a flash of movement. The tension dissipated with her departure, and I instantly felt more at ease. Yet I still found it hard to believe that we were even in the presence of vampires—I’d been in denial about their very existence for years.

  Only days ago, Abe had approached me on the street in London, and then at a society ball, warning me that the mysterious murders all over Europe were linked to a creature we had encountered in Transylvania—a vampire. I’d refused to believe him; it seemed impossible, but when my fiancé was abducted before my very eyes at the same ball by vampires, I could no longer deny what was happening. We had set out from London, determined to track down and destroy the creatures who had abducted my fiancé and bring him home.

  But along the way, our train had derailed on the way to Transylvania, and in the aftermath, I discovered the existence of my half-brother Gabriel, a human-vampire hybrid whose very existence revealed that my mother kept more secrets than my father ever had. Gabriel had brought us here to Budapest to meet Radu for answers . . . of which he had many.

  “Are there others who would be willing to fight with us?” I asked Radu, forcing my mind back to the present. “You told us of a group that was sent to kill Vlad—an order. Who were they?”

  Radu was still staring at the doorway, distracted by Anara’s departure. It took him several moments to respond.

  “Members of the Order of the Dragon,” he replied, his dark eyes finally sliding back to mine. “It was an order formed in the Middle Ages. An alliance between ancient vampire families and some trusted humans to maintain order amongst our kind, and to keep our existence hidden from humans. But there has not been an official meeting in over twenty years. After all that has happened, I suspect the surviving members want nothing more to do with the war. But,” he added, when my face fell, “there may be some who are still willing to fight. There is someone here in Budapest who may be willing to join us.”

  “Matyas?” Gabriel asked with a frown. “He loathes humans. He can barely tolerate me.”

  “He hates Vlad more, and he wants to see him destroyed,” Radu replied. Though his tone was calm, it was edged by steel. “He could be a useful ally.”

  “Who is Matyas?” Seward asked.

  “The leader of the vampires here in Budapest,” Radu answered. “Like my daughter, he is . . . distrustful of humans. I will need to speak with him before introducing you.”

  It seemed as if Gabriel wanted to protest, but he remained silent. I was apprehensive at the thought of being introduced to yet another hostile vampire. Anara had nearly killed us. What would this Matyas do?

  “I will not allow him to harm you,” Radu said, as if reading my mind. “As my guests, he will be expressly forbidden to do so. Matyas may not like humans, but he will not harm you without provocation.”

  I glanced over at Abe and Seward, who gave me quick nods of assent.

  “All right,” I agreed.

  Radu excused himself to contact Matyas, offering us his guest rooms to rest in until he sent for us.

  “Radu and other vampires can fight Vlad on their own. I can still escort you all back to England,” Gabriel said, as he led us out of the drawing room and up the stairs to the guest rooms.

  I tensed. I had grown weary of frequently being told to return to England without Jonathan. I opened my mouth to protest, but Seward interjected.

  “Don’t bother trying to persuade her. I’ve already made the same suggestion.”

  “She’s not going back to England without Jonathan,” Abe added, echoing my earlier statement. “You don’t know your sister yet—she can be quite stubborn. Her decision has been made since we left London.”

  Gabriel frowned, scrutinizing my determined features, but he said nothing.

  When we reached the guest rooms on the second floor, Abe asked Gabriel if he could question him further about his abilities while we waited. Abe’s scientific curiosity about vampires had only increased since being in direct contact with them, and he looked so comically delighted when Gabriel agreed that Seward and I smiled at each other behind his back, and the earlier friction dissipated.

  “You should rest, Abe,” I chided, my smile fading as I thought of the injury he had sustained during the train derailment on our journey here. “Your wound still needs—”

  “The wound is healing expeditiously,” Abe said, waving off my concerns. “I am fine, Mina. There is no need to worry about me.”

  They continued down the hall. I was tempted to join them, but fatigue had settled into my limbs like a heavy weight, and I knew I needed to have my wits about me if we were to have a discussion with Matyas.

  Like the drawing room, my room was fit for a noble or an aristocrat, with a large bed, a fireplace, and more oriental rugs. I curled up on top of the lush covers of the bed, forcibly clearing my mind of my turbulent thoughts, and I managed to drift off into a restless sleep.

  “If you

feel you are in danger, leave immediately. I will protect you,” Gabriel said to us in a low voice as we all descended the stairs two hours later. I’d just been awoken by Gabriel, and was still groggy from my nap. I had to struggle to concentrate on his words. “Long ago, Matyas’ whole family was killed by overzealous humans. He holds human life in no high regard.”

  “Christ,” Seward swore. “Why does Radu think he’ll work with us?”

  “Because Radu hopes he will put his hatred of humans aside to help destroy Vlad.”

  To my surprise, Anara was waiting for us at the base of the stairs. She wore a dress of dark purple silk and lace paired with a black cloak, her skin gleaming in the shadowy entrance hall. She looked the part of a mythic creature straight out of some dark fairy tale.

  “Come,” she said, turning to lead us down the entrance hall to a door at the opposite end. She pushed open the door, and it swung open to reveal a set of stairs leading to a massive cellar. There was a lit lantern perched in a wall holder, and she lifted it out before leading us down the stairs; the light from her lantern casting ominous shadows around the darkened cellar as we entered.

  She led us to another door, which opened onto a long winding corridor. I had heard of the extensive cave system that ran beneath the Buda Hills, but I didn’t know that they were linked to homes. Though the corridor that lie ahead of us was man made—with its stacked bricks and slots for torches—the ancient underground caves it was carved into had been made by nature.

  We entered, walking down the corridor for so long that I became nervous wondering exactly where Anara was taking us, until she abruptly turned into a cavernous room that must have once been a torture chamber with long, rusty metal cages, a fractured wooden rack, and several claw-like metal contraptions chained to its brick walls. It was lit by several ancient torches, which gave the room an eerie glow.

  Radu stood in the center of the room, next to another vampire whom I assumed was Matyas. Matyas was as tall as the other vampires in the room, with pale, angular features and icy blue eyes that gave him the appearance of a wolf in human form. He scrutinized each of us, his cold gaze lingering on me.

  Matyas approached us, stopping when he was only a foot away, his lips curling back in a derisive sneer.

  “A human woman. You believe that you can defeat Vlad?” he asked, his eyes trained on me, his words tinged with a strange accent that I did not recognize.

  “I–I don’t think we can defeat him alone,” I said, forcing the words past my lips, which had gone stiff with fear. There was a violence that simmered beneath the surface of this vampire—a violence that even Anara didn’t possess. “I know that we have the same desire to destroy them. That’s why we wish to make an alliance.”

  “I do not trust humans,” Matyas declared, turning back to Radu. “You know this. Their fear rules them; even now I can smell it all over them. I want nothing to do with the fight amongst vampires. It is futile. My followers in the city have already agreed. We have lost too many.”

  “You said you would consider their request,” Radu said tightly.

  “Do you not smell their fear? They would not hesitate to turn on us—to take up arms with other humans against us. The human woman can barely contain her fear and hatred for our kind.”

  “I don’t deny that I fear you,” I said, desperation forcing the words from my lips. Matyas whirled back to face me, his eyes narrowing as I continued. “Surely, you can’t blame me for being fearful of vampires? Vlad killed my father before my very eyes. But my desire to save my fiancé is greater than my fear, I assure you. Just as your hatred for Vlad must be stronger than your hatred for us.”

  Silence followed my words. Matyas’ eyes remained on me for a disconcertingly long moment, but I was becoming accustomed to the long looks of vampires, and I evenly held his gaze.

  “I will not join this fight,” he repeated, turning from me to address Radu. “Your wayward children are not my concern.”

  “I accept my responsibility for Vlad—and Ilona,” Radu bit out. “But I have wallowed in my regret for too long. They are bringing destruction to both the human and vampire world. Now is the time to end them.”

  “My decision stands,” Matyas said, not at all swayed by Radu’s argument.

  Radu straightened to his full height, taking a challenging step towards Matyas.

  “I will not forget this,” he hissed. “You have turned your back on your own kind out of cowardice.”

  Matyas snarled, a sound that was terrifyingly monstrous, and I instinctively took a step back. The imminent threat of violence in the room was palpable, and Gabriel moved to stand in front of us as Anara hurried to her father’s side. Radu didn’t flinch as Matyas drew closer to him.

  “I am far older and stronger than you. I could kill you where you stand,” Matyas seethed. “I will not stand for such insults.”

  “Matyas,” Anara said with forced cordialness, moving forward to step between the two vampires. “We accept your decision. There is no need for deyaner.”

  I did not recognize the strange word, but I noticed that all the vampires in the room froze at its mention. After a tense moment, Matyas backed away from Radu, though his eyes were still raging with fury.

  “Leave now or I will not be restrained.”

  “Radu . . . the decision has been made. Let’s take our leave,” Anara said, gripping Radu’s arm.

  Radu glared at Matyas before allowing Anara to lead him from the room. Gabriel ushered us out after them, shadowing us as we left the room. But I chanced one last glance back as we left, and I saw that Matyas was regarding me with an expression alight with a strange sort of . . . recognition.''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''“Matyas received the Blood during the height of the witch hunts,” Radu said. “He has seen the very worst of human nature, and he cannot look past it.”

  We had returned from the caverns and now sat gathered around the table in an opulent dining room over a meal of paprika hendl. Radu still looked tense from the confrontation with Matyas, his brow furrowed into an anxious frown.

  “Are there are any others who will help us?” Abe asked.

  “There is a small fortified village of vampires near Klausenburgh, in Transylvania,” Radu said. “Their leader is quite reasonable; she has always been against violence towards humans. If they are still there, I believe they will join us. It would also be a good place for us to prepare for the attack on my son’s fortress. If there is time, they can even train you.”

  “Train the humans?” Anara’s words were sharp with incredulity.

  “If they are to storm a fortress filled with vampires, they will need to be trained on how to fight them . . . even with other vampires protecting them,” Radu replied, unperturbed by her tone. “Who better to train them to fight vampires than vampires themselves?”

  “You’ve already agreed to ally with them,” Anara objected. “Now you want to teach them how to destroy us!”

  “In this fight we are on the same side, child,” Radu said, leveling her with a hard look. “You do not have to join us.”

  “Radu, I must insist—”

  “I will not repeat myself, nor will I argue with you,” Radu interrupted. Anara went rigid, and I thought that she would once again storm from the room. Instead, she looked down at the table, folding her shaking hands into her lap.

  “There is a village of only vampires? Are there many of these villages?” Abe asked. He was unaffected by the tension between Radu and Anara, and had taken out his journal, furiously scribbling down notes. “How old is Matyas? How old can vampires become?”

  “I am aware of at least seven such villages. Vampires who dislike the ruckus of large human populations prefer them. It is easier for us to live in cities without notice, but not in smaller human villages,” Radu answered. “Vampires are ageless . . . it is only by force or choice that we die. Matyas is one of the oldest vampires I know. He has nearly four hundred years.”

   Even though Radu had already indicated Matyas’ great age and I had sensed it from the vampire himself, I was still rattled with astonishment. Matyas had been alive since the fifteenth century. I recalled the coldness in his eyes, the immediate distrust when he looked at us. How much human cruelty had he seen over the centuries? How much had he personally experienced? It was no surprise that he did not trust us.

  I told Radu about the vampires in the clearing; the strange language they spoke and the fact that they had left me alive.

  “The language is our ancient tongue,” Radu replied. “I do not know—”

  “A language?” Abe interrupted, his eyes going wide as he jotted something down in his journal.

  “Long ago, we lived in complete isolation from humans, and we developed our own tongue. There are not many who speak it now that we live among humans—those who do are very old, or have learned it from their elders. I know some words, but my knowledge is not extensive. I do not know why they left you alive, but I am grateful that you were spared.”

  “What about Ghyslaine?” I asked.

  Radu frowned with confusion, and I told him of the word the vampires spoke to me in the clearing, and Vlad’s whisper to me on Westminster Bridge.

  “I am surprised my son seems to be aware of the word . . . it is not familiar to me,” Radu said, still frowning. “I am still young for a vampire, merely in my hundred and tenth year. But an older vampire may recognize it. We will come across them in Transylvania.”

  A sharp stab of disappointment pierced me at his response. I had so many questions and was hungry for answers, especially this particular one; I knew there had to be some crucial information I was missing. Ghyslaine, whatever the word meant, had to be a vital clue.

  Despite my lack of an appetite, I forced myself to eat, first taking a sip of the slivovitz—a sweet sort of brandy Gabriel told me was made from plums. The meal was as delicious as it smelled, and my stomach rumbled in satisfied appreciation when I began to eat.
   During the meal, Gabriel told us how he met Radu and Anara. He had come to Budapest for a visit several years ago, wanting to explore the ancient caves rumored to exist beneath the city, and found himself cornered by a hostile Matyas and several of his followers in an isolated part of the Castle District. Matyas had the ability to sense unfamiliar vampires who arrived in the city. He was immediately suspicious of Gabriel, as hybrids were exceedingly rare. Radu had come to Gabriel’s defense, shielding him from Matyas’ rancor by offering to host him as his guest, and he allowed Gabriel to stay with him whenever he visited the city.

  I looked at Anara, who was absently sipping the slivovitz, lost in her own thoughts, and I wondered how Radu had come to meet her. They weren’t biological father and daughter, so he must have been the one to turn her into vampire. But under what circumstances? Anara looked up and met my eyes, as if discerning what I was thinking, and I swiftly looked away.

  “You should all sleep,” Radu said, as our meal concluded. “We are to take the early morning train to Klausenburgh tomorrow.”

  But back in my guest room, I could not sleep. I crawled out of bed and sat down at the reading table, opening one of Abe’s journals that I had borrowed in order to read some of the notes he’d taken.

  Vampiric Abilities: Speed, enhanced hearing, visual prowess, esp at night. Great strength. Reduced / no aging (need to clarify) / does not die natural causes . . . immortal. Some—hypnosis, paralysis, telepathy. They call it ‘thrall’. Mind reading? Linked to telepathy? (Need to confirm)

  Weaknesses: Needs to consume blood to survive . . . no longer than two weeks, perhaps longer? Some—sensitive to light. Can only die when staked through the heart, otherwise injured but heal. Beheading also works. Other ways to kill unknown. Comparable species—wolves, possibly feline animals. Common descent possible?

  Note: need more info on Eva Murray, Mina’s mother.

  I froze at the mention of my mother, but turned the page and kept reading.

  How is Gabriel’s birth possible? Must be others like him. Note: Vampires able have biological children as well as “create” children i.e. Subjects Radu / Anara. But Mina’s mother human. How possible???

  I set down the journal on the table and wearily closed my eyes. Beneath the remnants of shock I had felt since learning of Gabriel’s existence, that same question had been fluttering about in my mind like a restless bird. There must be others like Gabriel, vampires born to human mothers. How many were there? Did some of them turn feral, or were they as kind and human-like as Gabriel? Did they have the ability to turn others into creatures like them? Or did they reproduce as humans did, creating more half-vampire children in the process? These questions were still in my mind as I fell asleep.

  We departed from Radu’s home early the next morning. It was strange and surreal to travel with vampires, watching them take their seats on the train amongst other humans who had no idea they were traveling with creatures of lore. Had I inadvertently ridden the Underground with vampires in London, or in my previous travels across the continent? Had I passed by them on the streets? Paid them no mind as I went about the monotony of my days?

  “It’s odd, isn’t it?” Seward whispered to me, clearly sharing my thoughts as the train pulled away from the station. Radu, Anara, and Gabriel sat behind us, and I could feel the chill of their cold eyes on my skin. “A few days ago I couldn’t even say the word ‘vampire’. And now . . .”

  “I don’t know if I will ever get used to the knowledge,” I quietly agreed.

  “At Scotland Yard, the inspector I trained under taught me a method,” Seward said. “A method that’s become handy. He urged me to not dismiss any possibility when it came to solving a crime—not unless it could be disproven.”

  “But some things can’t be disproven,” I said with a frown, thinking of some of the experiments Father had performed.

  “Well, that’s just it,” Seward replied with a shrug. “With what I was seeing, I couldn’t bloody well disprove that vampires were killing those people. And because I couldn’t, I didn’t dismiss it. I wanted to; the very notion was absurd. But the more I investigated the Ripper murders, and from my conversations with Abe, I knew there was no other explanation. Now look where we are,” he said, shaking his head in a daze and gesturing towards the vampires seated all around us. “Surrounded by them. And you’re related to one.”

  He gave me a wry smile, and I made myself return it, though I still felt uneasy as my gaze found Gabriel in the back of the train.

  Our train pulled into the Klausenburgh station just before noon. Abe took a cab to the post office to pick up the weapons the gunsmith had shipped from Amsterdam, before meeting up with us at the stables on the outskirts of town.

  At the stables, the stableman seemed to know Radu quite well, giving him a warm smile and embrace as he spoke to him in rapid German. He provided us with several horses, and we were soon riding out of Klausenburgh and into the surrounding countryside, crossing the wide expanse of the Somes Plateau, until we entered the ancient forests that seemed to dominate much of Transylvania.

  The same strong sense of nostalgia that had swept over me in Amsterdam affected me once more, but this nostalgia brought back far darker memories.

  Transylvania seemed to belong on a continent of its own, with its vast wilderness of forests, isolated lakes, streams and caverns, and the ever-present shadow of the Carpathians looming in the distance. Death seemed to abide here, something the locals seemed to embrace rather than shy away from with their religious rituals. There was the parastas, a memorial service held forty days after the deceased was buried to celebrate the soul’s departure to heaven; the eve of All Souls Day, when family graves were cleaned and candles lit to honor the dead; and the strange tradition of holding a nunta mortilor, a wedding of the dead for a deceased person who had died unmarried.

  And then there were the superstitions. The whispered rumors of witches, pixies, and hobgoblins that hid in the forests, ready to do harm to any humans who crossed their path. Father, Abe and I used to come across protective crosses on homes and wreaths of garlic hung in doorways to ward off supernatural evil. Vampires, the monsters in human skin who roamed the night, was the most pervasive rumor.

  Emerging from my reverie, I took in the vaguely familiar sights of the Transylvanian countryside. Every once in a while, we passed the crumbled ruins of some medieval castle off in the distance; Saxon towns, villages, fortified churches and farms otherwise dotted the landscape. But the region seemed more deserted than it had been when I first visited—many of the towns and villages we passed were now empty or sparsely populated. I wondered morbidly if this was what the rest of Europe would become. The world. Completely deserted as the population was killed, abducted, or fled.

  My hands were trembling on my reigns when we arrived at a fortified village sometime later. A high stone wall and several watchtowers surrounded the village on all sides, while a massive gate dominated its entrance. As our horses trotted towards the gate, Radu held up his hand.

  “Please remain here,” he said, addressing me, Abe and Seward.

  We obligingly lingered behind while Radu, Anara, and Gabriel rode towards the gate. As soon as they dismounted, the gate swung open.

  The woman who hurried out enveloped Radu in a warm embrace. She was petite with honey colored skin and fine features framed by a long cascade of dark wavy hair, and her eyes were a vivid mixture of green, brown, and gold. She turned to look at us, and I felt the unmistakable chill of a vampire’s gaze. I saw a brief flicker of recognition in her eyes as she studied me, but it quickly dissipated.

  Behind her, dozens of men and women approached the gate, looking both delighted and relieved to see Radu. Radu turned and gestured for us to follow them inside, and we dismounted from our horses, heading through the gate and into the central courtyard.

  A white steepled gothic hall church overlooked the large courtyard, which was dotted with a patchwork of vegetable gardens. Saxon-style

homes with thatched roofs lined the inner fortress wall, alongside storage cells that had been strategically built into the wall.

  I looked around at the people gathered in the courtyard, counting nearly fifty humans—and some vampires, I suspected. From their attire, I deduced that most of the humans were Romani; the women wore the traditional dress of colorful ankle-length skirts paired with aprons and scarves covering their hair, while the men wore hats, vests over their long-sleeved shirts, and boots. There seemed to be no obvious tension between the humans and vampires; they seemed unified, and we were the outsiders.

  “Both the Romani and vampires have been persecuted by humans,” Gabriel said softly. He stood at my side, and had noted my surprise. “Vampires have protected them, and they have shielded vampires in turn.”

  The female vampire introduced herself as Szabina and ushered us into the church, which was filled with rows of wooden pews, its high-vaulted ceiling making the small interior seem larger and more imposing. We sat in the front pews while the other humans and vampires crowded behind us and in the aisles.

  Radu addressed Szabina and the others in Romanian. I didn’t speak the language, but I assumed he was giving them a brief overview of our journey and our intention to get to the fortress to kill Vlad, and rescue Jonathan along with the other prisoners.

  As Radu spoke, Szabina’s eyes strayed to me. Though her countenance remained neutral, it seemed oddly probing. Did she know me somehow? When I met her gaze full on, Szabina averted her eyes, returning her focus to Radu.

  “Vlad and Ilona’s vampires have attacked near the human villages,” she said, speaking in heavily accented English for our benefit, when Radu had finished. “Those who have not been abducted or murdered have fled to the cities. Those who remain have joined those monsters out of fear. This is one of the few villages they have not attacked. They know vampires dwell here. But soon, they will come.”

  “Then time is of great importance,” Radu said urgently. “Will you join us?”

  “I do not think the humans should attempt to fight them,” Szabina said, once again glancing at me.

  “The humans will fight. They have come too far not to,” Radu said, before we could protest. “They have already survived two attacks by ferals. If you and the others are willing, they can be trained.”

  “We tried fighting back against them,” Szabina said, with quiet desperation. “It is why our numbers are low. We have lost many in the fight. We tried riding out to villages for others to fight with us, but no one is left. Whatever Vlad’s plan is . . . he is winning.”

  A grave silence fell, and my body grew cold with dread. The villagers back in Ijsbran had refused to join us, then Matyas, and now Szabina. Even with Radu, Anara, and Gabriel, how could we hope to attack the fortress if Vlad had hundreds of followers at his disposal? We could not attack on our own.

  “His plan is to invade. You must know that by now,” I said, getting to my feet to face Szabina and all who were gathered. “Our numbers are not great, but we can still fight. What is the alternative? To let them take over? To let them win? You say other villagers have fled. One day soon, there may be nowhere to flee to. We have no choice but to try to stop Vlad. We must.”

  As Szabina translated my words, I met the eyes of every human and vampire gathered around the church. The gazes that met mine ranged from caution, to wariness, to hope.

  “You know she speaks the truth, Szabina,” Radu said, when Szabina had finished translating.

  “She does,” Szabina replied, her eyes holding mine for a long moment. “But I will leave the choice up to the villagers.”

  She turned to face the others and spoke in hushed Romanian. I stood nervously as the humans and vampires began speaking amongst themselves. Finally, several men and women turned to Szabina, giving her an affirming nod.

  “Very well, Mina,” Szabina said, not meeting my eyes. “They have decided. We will fight one last time.”''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''We took a midday meal in one of the larger homes that lined the fortress wall, where we ate ghiveci—a hearty vegetable stew—and bread. Szabina, Radu, and a few of the curious human villagers joined us as we ate. Szabina and Radu remained in a corner of the large kitchen, speaking to each other in hushed tones. Szabina glanced over at me periodically, her expression tumultuous. I was increasingly convinced that she knew me somehow, and made a mental note to ask her when I had the chance.

  But in the meanwhile, I ignored Szabina’s frequent glances, focusing on one of the few English-speaking villagers, a young woman named Elisabeta, who sat with us. She had a cascade of dark curly hair and warm brown eyes, and she kindly answered our questions about the village. She told us that fortified villages such as this one were built in medieval times as a place of refuge for villagers during prolonged sieges and attacks. Such villages now provided a much-needed sanctuary, given the recent rash of vampire attacks.

  “My people weak to the attacks—we live on outskirts of villages. Szabina saved our life when our village attacked. She gave us shelter.”

  “Weren’t you afraid of them?” Seward asked.

  “We always known of the strigoi. Szabina is good. She one of us long ago. Strigoi who attacked—they not like Szabina or Radu. Their eyes black . . . their souls gone. Those strigoi we fear,” she added, with a shiver.

  “We need to prepare,” Radu interrupted, moving away from Szabina to take a seat at the far end of our table. “The fortress needs to be thoroughly scouted before we can make an accurate plan of attack. I am having two scouts ride ahead, which gives us a full day and a half to ready ourselves until they return. Szabina and the other vampires here will help train you.”

  Soon after our meal, Szabina gathered all the humans who were to fight in the central courtyard, ordering us to bring our weapons with us. Anara, Radu, Gabriel, and several other vampires moved to stand in an intimidating row in front of us.

  Despite her petite stature, I could tell that Szabina commanded much respect; she held everyone’s attention as she stepped forward, her multicolored eyes continually straying towards me as she addressed us in Romanian, and then English.

  “We are strong and we are fast. Many of us can hold our prey in thrall,” Szabina said, her voice carrying across the courtyard. “But we do have weaknesses. We can be staked or beheaded. Aim for here, or here,” she said, pointing to her heart, and then her throat. “Anywhere else may wound us, but not kill. For the thrall, avoid looking in the eyes . . . that is how we enter your mind.”

  She stopped speaking for a moment, allowing her words to settle. Next to me, Seward and Abe listened intently, and I could practically see Abe sorting the information in his mind to be added to his journal later.

  “Make certain you have your weapons. None of us will harm you, but the vampires at Vlad’s fortress will try to rip you apart,” she concluded darkly.

  I held one of my kukri knives in my left hand; the second one and a knife were securely stowed in my sleeves and the bodice of my dress. Around me, the other humans clutched knives and makeshift wooden stakes. Abe and Seward stood at my side. Seward had lost his revolver in the train derailment, and was now armed with two of Abe’s knives.

  Szabina nodded to the other vampires, and they moved into predatory crouches. Though I knew they would not harm us, apprehension filled me at the sight. Even Radu and Gabriel, whom I had slowly come to trust, looked lethal in their crouched positions.

  Szabina did not give us the order to run; she and the other vampires merely sprang towards us at an impossibly fast speed.

  My instincts set in, and I turned on my heel to race towards the open gates and out of the village, dashing into the depths of the surrounding forest with the other humans.

  Seward, Abe, and I kept pace together as we ran, but a vampire soon tackled Seward to the ground from behind, while another grabbed Abe and slammed him against a tree.

  I halted when the vampire grabbed Abe, raising my kukri to intervene,

but Abe’s eyes met mine as he struggled with the vampire.

  “Run, Mina!” he shouted.

  I had to remind myself that this was a training exercise; they would not harm Abe. But I was still fearful as I raced away from him.

  I only made it a few yards when a hand gripped my neck and pinned me down to the ground from behind. But the grip was gentle, and I twisted around to see Gabriel hovering above me.

  “You need to fight me, Mina,” he said. “You can wound me. I will heal.”

  I tried to yank myself out of his grip, but he was far too strong. I turned back to look at him, hesitant. My growing trust made me reluctant to wound him; I could not believe that I’d nearly killed him only two days ago.

  Seeing my continued hesitation, Gabriel yanked my head backward, more roughly this time, and bared his teeth. At the sight, my instincts took over, and I swiftly sank my kukri back into his shoulder. Gabriel let out a howl of pain, loosening his grip, and I stumbled to my feet to scramble away.

  The trees whipped past me as I ran, and through the forest depths I could vaguely hear frantic shouts and cries as the other humans fought off the vampires. But the sounds became more distant as I ran, and I soon found myself in a dark patch of forest.

  The trees grew closer together here, their density allowing very little sunlight to filter through their coiled branches—a dark prison erected by nature. A sense of dread crept over me, and I turned to race back towards the village.

  But as soon as I turned, I heard a vicious snarl from the black depths of the forest behind me, and felt the cold gaze of a vampire. Had I stumbled across a random feral roaming through the countryside? Had I strayed too far from the others?

  I started to dash out of the clearing, lifting up my skirt to pick up my speed, but when I heard the swift cracking of twigs and snapping of branches behind me, I knew the vampire was racing towards me and would soon overtake me. I continued to run, opening my mouth to let out a desperate scream to alert the others.
  A cold hand reached out and gripped me by my neck from behind, as Gabriel had done only moments earlier, abruptly cutting off my scream. This time, the hold was far rougher than my brother’s grip had been.

  My captor yanked me around. It was Anara, but I felt no relief at the sight of her; her eyes were ferocious and filled with the promise of violence.

  She dropped her hand from my throat. Her gaze remained trained on mine as my body lifted from the ground, and I was slammed hard against a nearby tree. Unable to move, terror flooded me as Anara stalked towards me like a wolf approaching fresh prey. When she reached me, her hand again went to my throat, her eyes burning like fire. Her hand tightened around my throat and I panicked as I struggled to breathe.

  We were completely alone in the clearing, and her face showed no hint of mercy as she continued to squeeze the air from my lungs. I had no way to defend myself, no way to fight back.

  I did not know why Anara hated me so, but even with her hand on my throat, I knew instinctively that she wasn’t evil. There was more to her, a pain and humanity that was absent from the mindless ferals I had encountered. I raised my eyes to hers in desperation, pleading with my eyes for her to release me. But when my eyes locked with hers . . . something strange happened. I saw something. Felt something.

  I was a young girl, my reed thin arms wrapped around my legs as I wept and rocked myself back and forth, seated in the center of the splintered wooden floor of a tiny cottage that had been ransacked; furniture and scraps of food were scattered about. In front of me, a man and a woman—my parents?—were being dragged away by a group of men.

  “Please! Don’t harm my little girl!” the woman screamed. Her pain was palpable; her body wracked with grief and terror. “Leave my Anara be! Please, she has done nothing! I beg you!”

  “Take me, please!” the man begged. “Leave my wife and child alone. Kill me, not them! Please!”

  “Mama!” I screamed. The word was thin and my throat was strained, as if I had been crying for days. I scrambled to my feet and raced towards my parents. “Papa!”

  One of the men stepped forward and backhanded me, sending me sailing across the room, and I hit the wall with such force that I slipped from consciousness.

  And then the scene was gone. I was back in the present, crouched on my hands and knees on the ground, coughing and gasping for breath. Anara had stumbled away from me, her hands pressed to the sides of her head, looking dazed.

  I was disoriented by what I had seen, but my self-preservation kept me focused, and I reached for the kukri that had dropped to the ground, holding it out defensively should she try to attack me again.

  But Anara made no move towards me, her eyes clouded with confusion as she looked at me, her breathing ragged. We stood at a stalemate for several moments, until I dimly heard multiple footfalls approach the clearing.

  “Mina!” Abe shouted as he raced into the clearing, his eyes sweeping over me with fretfulness. “I heard you scream. Are you—”

  “I’m . . . I’m all right,” I said hastily, as other humans and vampires began to file into the clearing.

  Gabriel hurried into the clearing, pushing past the others, his gaze straying suspiciously from me to Anara. When he saw my throat, he grabbed Anara and pinned her to a tree, his lips curled back in a ferocious snarl.

  “Did you harm my sister?” he roared.

  But Anara was unfazed by Gabriel’s fury. She was still focused on me, her confused expression shifting to one of suspicion.

  “How did you do that?” she demanded, ignoring Gabriel. “You were in my mind. You did something to me!”

  “You are far stronger and she’s the one who is bruised! Answer me!” Gabriel shouted.

  “What is happening?” Szabina asked sharply. She and Radu entered the clearing, moving past the cluster of humans and vampires who had gathered.

  “She attacked my sister!” Gabriel snapped.

  “Anara. I already warned you—” Radu began, looking furious.

  “I–I wasn’t going to kill her! She was able to release herself from the thrall, which is impossible!” Anara cried, pointing a quivering finger at me. “She was in my mind. I felt her!”

  Szabina stiffened at her words, and I saw alarm flicker in her eyes.

  “Harming the humans is forbidden,” Szabina said, disregarding Anara’s words, her voice strained.

  “You are dismissed from the training,” Radu added. “I will discuss this with you later. Please escort her back to the village,” he quietly ordered two hovering vampires, who approached Anara.

  “Listen to me! She looked at me, I felt something in my mind, and I could no longer hold her in thrall. No human has ever done that to me before!” Anara cried fervently, as the two vampires gripped her arms to lead her away.

  But Radu and Szabina didn’t look at her, and once she was gone, Szabina approached, studying me closely.

  “Is that true?” she asked. “You released yourself from the thrall?”

  A hush fell as Abe, and all the others who were gathered, turned curious and awestruck looks towards me. I flushed, suddenly feeling oddly defensive, as if I had done something wrong.

  “I–I just looked into her eyes, and I saw—I think I saw something from Anara’s childhood. It was like a dream. Or a memory. Her parents were being dragged away.”

  Radu went rigid at my words, frowning. The silence stretched.

  “Perhaps it was my desperation,” I said hastily, unable to bear the silence or the strange looks the others were giving me. “If one of you can put me into another thrall, I can show you all what I did, and then—”

  “No,” Gabriel interjected. “It is too dangerous, and there’s no guarantee you will be able to release yourself again.”

  “We need to learn to defend ourselves against the thrall! It’s one of your most powerful weapons,” I protested. “If I can teach others to do what I just did, our chances against Vlad and his followers are even greater.”

  “I agree with Gabriel,” Abe said, looking worried. “It is far too dangerous.”

  “My daughter was right,” Radu spoke up, looking at me intently. “We are not aware of any other human who has been able to release themselves from the thrall. Others here may not be able to do the same.”

  Tendrils of unease curled around me as everyone continued to look at me like I was a newly discovered specimen. What did it mean that I was able to break the thrall? Yet another question to add to the mountain of unknowns.

  “We are losing time. Let us take a break from the training,” Szabina said. “We meet back in the courtyard.”

  Everyone began to scatter, casting curious glances at me as they did so. Abe, Seward, and Gabriel approached me, and beneath their polite urgings for me to get some rest, I could see the inquisitiveness in their eyes at this newly discovered ability of mine.

  I barely listened to their words. My focus was on Szabina, who remained at the edge of the clearing, watching me with turbulent eyes, before she turned to head back towards the village.

  “Are you listening?” Abe asked impatiently. “I want to examine your neck to see if there—”

  “Wait here,” I said shortly, leaving them behind as I hurried after Szabina. I was determined to find out the cause of her frequent looks.

  She seemed to sense that I was following her, as she picked up her pace. Worried that she would use her vampiric speed to evade me, I quickly jogged forward to move in front of her, blocking her path.

  “You keep looking at me. Why?” I demanded.

  When Szabina stiffened, averting her eyes, I knew that my inkling was correct. She knew something, and for whatever reason, she was hiding it from me.

  “Szabina, please. Do you know something about me?” I pressed. “There is so much that I don’t know about my own past, my own life. If you know something, please . . .” my voice broke, and I had to blink back my tears.

  Compassion flared in her eyes, and she expelled a long breath.
  “I did not want to believe it at first . . . I still cannot,” she said. “But I have only seen one human break the thrall of a vampire, and I have lived many years. Do you know the name Ghyslaine?”

  I froze as my heart began to pummel against my ribcage. Ghyslaine. It did mean something—something vital. I could see it in her eyes. And she knew my connection to it.

  I felt a sudden and strange sense of stillness; like the calm right before a violent storm. I had felt it right before Gabriel revealed his identity, and the night that I stumbled into that clearing to find my father’s dead body. It was the sense that everything would soon change, and my world would not be the same.

  Szabina’s vivid eyes were now shimmering with blood tears. She stepped forward, placing cold trembling hands on the side of my face, gazing at me with a look of near reverence.

  “Wilhelmina Murray,” Szabina whispered. “I know who you are.”''',

      ''' “Once upon a time, there lived a little girl,” my mother whispered.

  I was five years old, seated with my legs tucked beneath me on my bed. It was night, long past my bedtime, but I was wide awake. My mother sat next to me, her eyes distant as she lovingly stroked my hair. The moonlight that filtered in my bedroom window gave her face an eerie glow.

  “What was her name?” I asked eagerly.

  “Isabel,” Mother replied, after a long pause. “Isabel was the youngest daughter of a family that killed monsters.”

  “Monsters?” I whispered, my hands flying to my mouth. “What kind of monsters?”

  “Monsters that look like us. Only they take blood. They take life,” Mother replied, her eyes going dark. “But Isabel’s family realized that not all these monsters are evil.”

  “But monsters are evil!” I objected.

  “Not so, poppet,” Mother said, with a small smile that was more sad than amused. “Many of them could not help that they were monsters. They never harmed humans . . . they only wanted to live in peace. Isabel’s family stopped hunting them, and much time passed. But many of the bad monsters remembered the family. They hunted them down. One by one, all the family members were killed, until there was only one left alive.”

  I drew my knees up to my chest, wrapping my arms around my legs. I usually liked Mother’s stories, but this one was frightening. Yet I still wanted to know more.

  “Who was left?” I asked nervously.

  “A little girl named Wilhelmina,” Mother replied, pinching my nose affectionately. I giggled, turning my head away. Mother fell silent once more, her hand dropping to the blanket, her eyes growing distant once more. “Wilhelmina was the only one left, but she did not know it. It was best that she did not know, because if the monsters knew about her, they would come after her. But they will not,” she added reassuringly, noticing my alarm. “Because she was hidden away in the biggest city of the human world with a different name; impossible to find. She was . . . she was safe. She lived a long and happy life, away from the monsters and darkness.”

  In the faint light, I thought I saw a shimmer of tears in her troubled brown eyes.

  “Mama, is this just a story?” I asked.

  “Of course, poppet,” she swiftly replied, reaching out to gently cup my chin with a consoling smile. But there was a strain to the smile, and her hand trembled slightly on my face. “Just a story.”

  I now recalled the story as I stumbled through the forest outside of the village, hot tears staining my cheeks. Behind me, I could feel both Abe and Gabriel’s concerned gazes on my back as they trailed me. I stopped to lean heavily against a tree, closing my eyes against a fresh rush of tears.

  The story my mother told me all those years ago had not been a mere bedtime story.

  In the stunned wake that followed Szabina’s words, she gently led me back to the church, sitting me down in the front pew. I was still reeling, and barely noticed as she politely ushered out the few humans who were congregated inside until we were alone. She must have sent for the others, because Gabriel, Abe, Seward, and Radu soon joined us. Szabina moved to the altar, gesturing for Gabriel to sit next to me in the front pew.

  “Ghyslaine is your mother’s family name,” she said somberly, her eyes trained on the both of us.

  I blinked at her in confusion. I did not quite know what I was expecting, but it wasn’t this.

  “No,” I said, shaking my head. “My mother’s maiden name was Smith.”

  “That was the name she took when she left France for England,” Szabina replied. “Eva Smith. She changed it to protect her identity. Her name was Isabel Ghyslaine.”

  The blood drained from my face. Aside from Abe’s sharp intake of breath behind me, the church was still and silent.

  “The Ghyslaines were once a noble family who learned of vampires before most humans,” Szabina spoke slowly and softly, as if keenly aware of the weight of each word. “They were already brutal and efficient witch hunters. They were often ordered by royalty to lead the hunts. But there are no witches . . . there have not been for ages. They discovered vampires through their hunts, and the Ghyslaine family massacred scores of vampires. They soon stopped—no one knows why—but they were so hated by our kind that when they began to lose their lands and decline in power, their descendants were hunted down and killed. Many changed their names and went into hiding. Your mother belonged to possibly the last family of descendants. But her family . . . they were good. They were ashamed of the family’s legacy and protected vampires rather than hunt them. Your grandfather was a member of the Order of the Dragon. When he died, your mother took his place. I was a member as well; that is how I came to know her. She was a good person.”

  I couldn’t move nor speak, and I was forced into a shocked stillness for several moments.

  “She . . . she was ill. She died at sea when she left to get treatment,” I whispered when I was able to find words. I was still struggling to hold on to some threads of truth that I had always known, threads that were now slipping through my fingers. “I–I saw her sick in her bed. Father showed me the headline about the boat sinking; the ticket she purchased. I . . . we held a funeral.”

  “She needed to use deceit in order to leave. She was very involved in the fight against Vlad. She was one of the members who attempted to kill him. She hoped that she could kill Vlad and return home to her children. She did not want you to know any of this—not even your father knew,” Szabina whispered, guilt darting across her expression. “She made me vow to never tell of her fate should she be killed in the fight. I never thought I would meet you. I still cannot believe I stand opposite her children.”

  “What of my father?” Gabriel bit out. “Who was he?”

  “I do not know. She kept that secret. She insisted that he was dead.”

  “How did she die?” I whispered.

  “She was one of the members of the Order killed in retaliation for his death. I am so sorry,” she said mournfully, her eyes once again glistening with a sheen of blood tears. “We tried to protect the ones who fought Vlad, but his followers were fiercely loyal, angry, and determined. They got to her before we could stop them.”

  Gabriel buried his face in his hands and began to weep. I suspected my mother’s death had been a great burden for him; he’d known and remembered her more than I did, and he’d been forced to mourn her death from afar, to shoulder it all on his own. My hand seemed to reach out of its own accord to grip one of his hands, and his hand tightened over mine as he continued to weep.

  Grief felt somewhat lighter when it was shared, and I felt a sense of solidarity with Gabriel because of it. Any lingering doubt or unease about what he was had completely dissipated. In that moment, we were just two orphaned children, sharing the heavy weight of parental loss. Everyone else in the church was silent, allowing us this moment to grieve.

  In the long silence, memories seized my thoughts. I was once again a five-year-old child, hovering in the doorway of Mother’s bedroom while a nurse

tended to her, her sad eyes trained on me. And then she was hovering above me as I tried to sleep, her anguished face glowing in the moonlight, making her appear ethereal and dream like. I must leave. But never forget my love for you, poppet. I love you always. Father was kneeling down next to me, brushing my hair back from my face, his voice wavering as he spoke. Your mother has gone away to get well. She will be better when she returns. The solemn funeral on that rainy October day, Father’s hand clutching mine, the rain mingling with the tears on my cheeks.

  “How did they kill her?” I asked suddenly, forcing the ugly question past my lips.

  “Mina,” Abe’s concerned voice was behind me, close to my ear, his hand reaching out to rest on my shoulder. “There’s no need—”

  “I’ve been kept in the dark for too long,” I interrupted. “I need to know.”

  “As do I,” Gabriel whispered, looking pained.

  “Mina,” Szabina said, shaking her head. “I do not think—”

  “Tell us. We are her children. We deserve to know.”

  “She was in hiding in a house in the German countryside,” Szabina said, hesitant. “It was a brief stay . . . just until it was safe for her to return home. She did not want to risk vengeful vampires following her back to London. But Vlad’s followers found her. When we got to her, it was too late. She looked . . . she looked as if she had been tortured. Her body had been drained of blood. We knew we could not send her body back to England, Robert would know that she had not died natural. On the day your mother left England, a ship sank in the Channel; many bodies were lost at sea. We . . . we arranged—” Szabina faltered, lowering her eyes, guilt lurking in their depths, “a forged ticket in her name, and sent a letter to your father telling him that she was on the boat—and her body was lost at sea. We buried her in France with others of her family.”
  I closed my eyes. I had wanted to know how she died, needed to know, but the circumstances of her death were even more horrible than I could comprehend. I felt no anger towards Szabina for her actions in hiding the true nature of Mother’s death—it was clear that it had been Mother’s wish. Instead, I only felt a strange numbness. Everything I believed about myself was false; I was heir to a dark legacy that I could no longer deny.

  Without a word, I got to my feet and walked out of the church, ignoring Abe as he called after me. Both Abe and Gabriel trailed me as I continued through the central courtyard, past the two vampires who stood guard by the village gate, and into the forest.

  Now, they hovered behind me as the numbness dissipated and I began to weep. I wept for my parents, who had both died at the hands of vampires. For my years of ignorance. For Jonathan, whose fate I desperately feared for.

  But I did feel an odd sense of completion. The gaps in my knowledge of the past were filled, and I no longer desired my previous ignorance. I felt like a blind woman who had just received the gift of sight after wandering for years in the dark. For the first time, I truly knew who I was and what I had to do. The sudden surge of determination that swelled in my chest was so strong that it overpowered my other tumultuous emotions, and a sort of calm settled over me.

  I straightened, wiping away my tears, turning to face Abe and Gabriel. Gabriel still looked grief-stricken, his eyes glistening with tears, while Abe’s face was heavy with worry.

  “I have an idea,” I whispered.

  “My mother was able to release herself from the thrall, was she not?” I asked Szabina. “She’s the one you were referring to.”

  We had returned to the church, where Szabina and Radu had remained, speaking quietly to each other. Seward still sat in his pew, looking dazed from the latest revelations. He rose from his seat as we entered.

  “Yes,” Szabina replied. “She was the only human I knew who could do such a thing. It made her invaluable in the fight against Vlad.”

  “Vlad and his followers hate the Ghyslaine family and it appears many of them somehow know that I’m a descendant.”

  “You have the look of your mother, and some vampires can smell it in your blood,” Szabina replied with a nod.

  “They can smell her ancestry in her blood?” Abe asked, intrigued.

  “Yes. Every human has a smell—from their skin, their blood. Families share similar smells. It is not common, but some vampires do have a greater sense of smell than others; it can be passed on to other vampires they create.”

  “Is it possible that I’m one of the last descendants of this Ghyslaine family?” I asked Szabina, trying to keep my voice steady as I drew everyone’s focus back to me. There was no time for Abe’s scientific musings about the vampiric sense of smell. Not with what I was planning.

  “Yes,” Szabina acknowledged.

  “Then when we attack the fortress, I should be used as bait to draw them out,” I continued. “It may be the best way we have of entering.”

  “No!” Gabriel protested. “After what we have just learned, how can you even think of—”

  “Nothing has changed, Gabriel. I’m now even more desperate to rescue Jonathan—and avenge our mother and my father. We must find a way in without a massive loss of life. We don’t have the numbers to just charge forward. If their focus is on me, they will send their forces out and give the rest of you the time you need to enter. Once we have them scattered—”

  “We can enter the fortress in waves and attack,” Radu said, completing my thought.

  “Radu,” Gabriel breathed. “You’re not—”

  “Mina is right,” Radu interrupted. “We do need a way to lower their defenses. It is what I have been discussing with the others. We have already considered using some of the human villagers as bait if they are willing. Are you certain about this, Mina?”

  “Yes.” There was no hesitation in my voice, though dread stirred in my stomach at the thought, dread that I quickly pushed aside. I had to do whatever it took to get Jonathan away from those monsters.

  Gabriel moved to stand in front of me, gripping my shoulders, his desperate eyes searching mine.

  “Our mother didn’t want us to know about any of this,” he said. “Your father never wanted you to return to Transylvania. If you put yourself in Vlad’s path, you are defying what they—”

  “What would you have me do? Go back to London and let these creatures take over Europe and the rest of the world? My parents’ secrets didn’t keep me, nor anyone safe. It only prolonged the inevitable. I will no longer hide from this. I must do what I can to destroy Vlad and save my fiancé. Stop trying to dissuade me!”

  Gabriel dropped his hands from my shoulders, his face turbulent.

  “I know you made a promise to her, Gabriel. But I must do this. I’m doing this for our mother—for all of us. I’m finishing what she started. Please understand,” I said, my tone softening.

  Gabriel’s eyes darkened and he took a step back from me.

  “I have failed her,” he whispered, turning to leave the church.

  “I will discuss this new plan with the others. Everyone will need to know their roles,” Radu said after Gabriel’s abrupt departure. Szabina nodded, giving me a long look before she and Radu filed out of the church.

  Abe, Seward, and I were now alone. I sank back down into the pew, staring dully out of the windows which illuminated the interior of the church with the fading light of the sun. Abe and Seward were silent, but I could feel their gazes on my skin.

  “If you’re going to try to change my mind—” I began, turning to face them.

  “We know better,” Seward interjected, giving me a small smile. “I’m going to see what I can do to help the others. I’ll leave you alone.”

  Abe lingered for a moment before following Seward, and I sat alone in the stillness of the church. I thought of my mother, Isabel Ghyslaine, the mysterious and shadowy figure from my early childhood, who had now taken on a fully formed image in my mind. She had been brave, strong, loyal, and loving. How had she managed to keep so many secrets? To know of the dark world of vampires that lurked unnoticed in the midst of humans, an invisible storm cloud that hovered above the entire world. How isolated she must have felt towards the end of her life, to bear such a secret alone. She had a brief taste of normalcy and happiness with her children and her husband, before it was snatched from her. The tragedy of her short life and death suddenly hit me with a force so strong that I keeled over in the pew, wrapping my arms around my body.

  I closed my eyes against the tears that rose, sharply blinking them away. The time for tears had passed. My mother’s burden had become my own, and after years of ignorance, it was time for me to complete what Isabel Ghyslaine had set out to do with the other members of the Order of the Dragon. Destroy Vlad Alexandru Draculesti, and those that followed him.''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''I dashed through the thicket of trees, their branches whipping past as I hurtled by. Behind me, several vampires gave chase, rapidly closing in on me. I skidded to a stop as I reached a small clearing, where Szabina was waiting, crouched in the familiar stance of attack.

  Trying to steady my breathing, I raised my kukri, but Szabina lunged forward before I could, pinning me down beneath her as she bared her elongated fangs. A strangled scream caught in my throat as she leaned in close, her fangs a mere inch from my throat.

  She released me, springing back to her feet as she looked down at me with grave disappointment.

  “You are dead,” she said wearily. “Mina, you are not using your instincts.”

  I struggled to my feet, discouraged. Though this was just a training session, the chase had left me shaken. Szabina and the other vampires had been training me for hours now, and I could feel the heat of the midday sun penetrating the thick shade of trees, heating my flushed and sweating skin.

  When I left the church the evening before, Radu and Szabina announced

that training would continue the next day. I had eaten a dinner of mamaliga—a sort of porridge—and leftover vegetable stew in Szabina’s home with Abe and Seward, before Elisabeta led us to our quarters for the night. Abe and Seward stayed in one of the homes with Gabriel and two other male villagers while I stayed in Elisabeta’s home. She insisted that as the guest, I use the bedroom and waved away my protests as she left to sleep in the main room.

  Despite my turbulent emotions, I managed to fall asleep quickly, with Jonathan’s photo clutched in my hand.

  As I ate breakfast with the others the next morning, Radu informed us that the scouts had returned and it was time to continue preparing for the next day’s attack. He detailed the plan of penetrating the fortress, emphasizing my role as the first to approach. Multiple stunned gazes fell on me at the announcement, and I had to force myself to maintain a stoic countenance. Since I was so integral to the initial attack, Radu insisted that I train on my own and separately from the others.

  I had now spent hours under Szabina’s tutelage, who trained me with several other vampires from the village. I had felt Anara’s eyes on me that morning, her expression indiscernible, but to my relief, I overheard Radu inform her that she was not to be included in my training after her actions the day before.

  With Szabina and the others, I had practiced my flight on foot and on horseback, as well as warding off attacking vampires with my kukri, the stakes, and the wolfsbane. But I still felt desperately unprepared, and tears of frustration welled in my eyes as I dusted myself off.

  “You do not have to do this,” Szabina said, assessing my distress. “We can find another way to enter the—””

  “No,” I cut her off, wiping at my eyes. As terrified as I was, I knew that using me as bait was the best way to weaken their initial defense. “I can do it.”

  “Then we need to keep training,” Szabina said. “There is no time for rest.”

  She had barely completed the sentence when I was once again thrown back against a nearby tree, unable to move. She had placed me into a thrall. She crept towards me, her fangs bared and her eyes lethal, while the other hovering vampires watched in silence.

  Though I knew Szabina would not harm me the way Anara had, fear stirred in me as the paralysis took hold. I concentrated on her eyes, as I had with Anara. And once again, I saw a flurry of images. It was like being an active part of a waking dream.

  I was a young woman, encircled in the arms of a handsome male vampire. We were standing in a darkened forest clearing, and I felt a combination of both love and sorrow as his head dipped towards my throat, his fangs sinking into the soft flesh.

  I was released from the hold, throwing out my arms to break my fall as I plummeted to the ground. Szabina stumbled back from me, her trembling hands pressed to the sides of her head. I took advantage of her disorientation to leap to my feet, my kukri outstretched, placing the blade against her neck as I evenly met her eyes. Szabina still looked out of sorts, but she gave me a small nod of approval.

  “Nikolaus, Kudret,” she said, turning towards two of the hovering vampires. I recognized them as the vampires Radu had sent on the scout to the fortress. Though one was light and the other dark—Nikolaus with light brown hair and blue eyes, Kudret with dark hair and brown eyes—they could have almost been brothers, with their similar muscular builds and striking handsome features. “Please continue her training. I–I will return.”

  “I would like to help,” Gabriel said quietly.

  I whirled in surprise as Gabriel stepped from the cluster of trees behind us. He had not said a word to me since our row in the church yesterday, and his face was conciliatory as he approached.

  “If . . . if it’s not a bother,” he added.

  “No,” I said, giving him a small smile. “Not at all.”

  Szabina gave him a nod as she left, and we remained in the clearing until the sun began its descent towards the horizon. Gabriel and the others trained me on how to evade attacks, practice offensive moves, and even how to disguise my scent with dirt. By the time Szabina returned to the clearing to end the training, my limbs were sore and screaming with protest.

  “You have done well, Mina,” Szabina said as the other vampires began to file out of the clearing. “Sleep well tonight. You need to rest.”

  I watched her file out of the clearing after the others, wondering about the images I had seen. Who was that male vampire? What was her connection to him?

  “Mina,” Gabriel said, coming to stand at my side. “I want to apologize for—”

  “There is no need,” I said, shaking my head. “You promised our mother you would keep me safe. I understand your concern.”

  “It is not just my promise to her. You are my only family. I worry for you as my sister. I will not try to dissuade you again, but please be careful tomorrow. Vlad, Ilona and his followers are vicious.”

  “I know,” I said, though a chill swept through me at his words. “I’ll be careful. I promise.”

  “Mother said you would be headstrong. I underestimated how much,” Gabriel said, his lips twitching with a wry smile as we headed back towards the village. “She said you weren’t like other little girls—you had an insatiable curiosity, an intelligence beyond your years. She seemed to know you would not have a common life.”

  “Gabriel?” I asked, stopping as we reached the front gate of the village. He looked down at me with a raised brow. “How . . . how was she?”

  I had been meaning to ask Gabriel about my mother, but my previous fear of him and shock at his very existence had prevented me from doing so. Even with all that Szabina had told me, I was still hungry for any knowledge about her.

  “Kind. Loving. She had great humor. I remember once when I was still a boy, she came to the house to take me into town. She bought me a sweet ice and found a group of children for me to play street football with. I wasn’t often around other children. They didn’t seem to care that I looked different, and it was the most fun I’d had in quite some time. I won the first round, and when I looked over to see if Mother saw . . . there were tears in her eyes. I thought I’d done something to upset her. But when I asked her what was the matter, she assured me she was all right,” Gabriel said, looking haunted by the memory. “There were many times when she was like that. Distant. Sad. I still wonder what she was thinking about when she seemed to lose herself.”

  His voice trailed off on the last word, and he turned from me to enter the gate, his body taut with renewed grief. As I watched him go, a powerful thought swept through my mind. I will avenge her for you. I will avenge her for us both.

  During dinner in Szabina’s home, I ate in tense silence with Abe, Seward, and Gabriel. I had no doubt they were as nervous about the next day’s attack as I was. Radu stepped in to urge us to get as much rest as possible; we would be awoken to leave when it was still dark. Before he left, his gaze found mine and held it, as if searching for any hesitation, but I steadily returned his look.

  When we were alone, Seward solemnly lifted his cup of water, looking at each one of us.

  “A drink,” he said. “To killing vampires. Ah, I mean—” he faltered, his eyes straying to Gabriel, his cheeks filling with color.

  “It is no bother,” Gabriel said, amused.

  “To defeating evil vampires,” Abe corrected, giving Seward a rueful smile.

  We lifted our cups to meet his own. As everyone drank, I set mine down.

  “I wanted to thank you all,” I said. “For taking this journey with me. I was mad to think I could do this on my own.”

  “You and I started this journey together, before we were even aware,” Abe replied. “Years ago, in that forest where your father was murdered. It is apropos that we shall finish it together.”

  “Let’s pray we can kill those bloody things,” Seward said. “God help us if we fail.”

  We headed to our quarters, Abe lingering behind to fall into step beside me as Seward and Gabriel went ahead.

  “Are you well

enough to fight tomorrow?” I asked, my eyes flickering down to his side with concern.

  “Yes. I was quite all right during the training, the wound has healed well and I no longer feel any pain. You fret too much, Mina,” Abe replied, giving me a wry look. “I should be the one worried about you.”

  “I’ll be all right,” I said hastily, looking up at the night sky that was blanketed with stars. I stopped walking, taking it in as a sudden memory assailed me.

  “Remember the night rides we took with Father?” I asked. “To try and locate what specimens we could find in the dark?”

  “Yes,” he replied, with a fleeting smile.

  “The stars on those nights in the countryside, it was such a beautiful sight,” I mused, feeling an ache at the memory. We had not yet heard rumors of wolf attacks in the Transylvanian countryside, the tales of strigoi had seemed like superstitious nonsense, and the future was still rife with wonder and possibility. I had no idea of the monsters in our midst—the monsters I would be forced to confront.

  “Many could die tomorrow, Mina,” Abe said bluntly. His words sent me careening back to the present, and I whirled to face him, taken aback by his grim words. “I could die.”

  “No, Abe,” I whispered. “Do not say such things. We have a plan. It will mitigate loss of life. You are certainly not going to die tomorrow. I won’t hear of it.”

  “This whole journey we have been perilously close to death—Arthur’s demise proves it. Tomorrow we will be closer to it than we ever have before. If I do die tomorrow,” he continued gravely, taking a step closer to me, his voice dropping to an intimate whisper. “Rescue your fiancé. Take him home to London, marry him, and live the life your mother wanted you to live. Away from monsters and darkness. Live in the light of the sun. After all that you have been through, I want you to be happy, Mina. Your happiness is all that I have ever wanted.”

  I could tell there was something he wasn’t telling me, something that he dare not say aloud, and I suspected I knew what it was. He was studying me intently, waiting for my response—needing my promise, as Arthur had on that boat in the North Sea.
  But I would not give him the promise he wanted to hear. His words stirred up dormant emotions that once again rose to the surface, only this time I did not try to suppress them. I had realized something I long suspected to be true; something I’d tried to deny for three long years. Though I loved Jonathan with all of my heart, I also loved Abe, and I could not bear the thought of losing either of them. I would ride to the ends of the earth to rescue him, just as I had with Jonathan.

  “I can’t promise you that,” I said, my eyes locking with his. He paled at my response, and I continued. “Yes, I will rescue Jonathan and take him home. But if you die tomorrow… I will never be happy again. You stay alive, Abraham Van Helsing.”''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''The fortress was perched on a low peak of the Carpathians, the spires of its towers winding out of the fog and towards the early morning sky like a fallen angel beseeching the heavens. My hands quivered as I gripped the reigns of my horse, guiding it up the precariously steep mountain path that led to the fortress’ gatehouse. I could almost feel the hesitation in the tightly coiled muscles of my horse as he clamored up the path; it was as if he somehow knew we were entering the realm of monsters.

  I cast a glance back down the mountain path, towards the cluster of trees at the base where Radu, Szabina, Anara, Gabriel and the others were lying in wait.

  Before we had left the fortified village, hours earlier when night still warded off the dawn, Radu had briefly ran through the plan once more. Human volunteers would willingly let Vlad’s scouts capture them, whom Nikolaus and Kudret had witnessed patrolling the outskirts of the fortress. Abe, Seward, Elisabeta, and several of the human villagers had bravely volunteered for the task. Soon after their capture, I would approach the fortress on my horse, making sure to be in full view of the watchtowers. When the gatehouse doors lifted and Vlad’s vampires inevitably came towards me, I was to turn around and ride back down the path and into the surrounding forest, where Radu and the other vampires would be waiting. Together, they would surround the attacking force and slaughter them, and we would all enter the fortress through the open gates.

  Abe, Seward and the other human volunteers had left ahead of us, their clothes dirty and torn, disguised as roaming peasants. Seward had given me a warm embrace of farewell, but Abe had tactfully avoided me, not even meeting my eyes as he climbed onto his horse. When I’d hurried forward to bid him farewell, his eyes only briefly met mine and he’d given me a curt nod before he galloped away. I watched him go with a searing aguish in my chest, silently praying that I would see him again. But I had set it aside, forcing myself to focus on the battle that lay ahead as I made my way out of the village and towards the fortress.

  Our journey had been silent with foreboding. The forests had seemed to deepen and grow thicker as we drew closer to the fortress, and it truly felt as if we were leaving civilization behind and entering a dark world where nightmares were a reality.

  We finally arrived at the base of the fortress as the sun began its ascent into the sky, hiding ourselves in a cluster of trees. Gabriel had dismounted and, without a word, pulled me into his arms. Though his skin bore the cold of a vampire, I felt a surprising warmth at his touch, and I leaned into his embrace. When he stepped back, his face was shadowed with worry. I suspected there was much more he wanted to say, but his words were brief.

  “Be safe, sister,” he whispered.

  Radu and Szabina gave me assuring nods, while Anara met my eyes with a look of detached impassiveness. I mounted my horse, leading him on a slow trot out of the forest and up the mountain path.

  Now, as I made my way closer to the fortress, I could see the barbican leading towards the imposing iron gatehouse, and my pulse increased, battering away at my skin. I had no doubt that I had been seen from one of the towers, and it was only a matter of time before I was pursued. I brushed my fingers against the kukri that was tucked beneath the left sleeve of my dress, and the second one that was tucked beneath my right sleeve. There was a stake and a knife stowed in my bodice, along with a pouch of wolfsbane, which was also wound into my tight bun.

  Despite my weapons, I felt great trepidation at the thought of what I would soon face, and my hands trembled even more as I gripped the reigns. I forced myself to think of Jonathan, trapped somewhere inside the imposing fortress, and the thought was all I needed to urge my horse forward until we were moving in a full gallop towards the gatehouse.

  Up ahead, the jagged iron gates of the fortress slowly screeched upwards, but no one came out. I pulled back on the reigns of my horse, bringing him to a complete stop, and scanned the courtyard that lay behind the gates. Thick fog encased the courtyard, and after several long moments that seemed suspended in time, a small group of figures emerged like apparitions through the fog.

  Vampires clamored out of the gatehouse and down the path of the barbican, their fangs bared in fierce snarls.

  I recognized one of them. It was Matyas, the vampire in Budapest who had refused to join us. Rage and panic flared in my chest at the sight of him. If he was on Vlad’s side, he must have told him of our plan.

  I acted quickly, steering my horse around and clamoring back down the steep incline. The vampires’ horses were getting closer, and I could almost feel the hatred radiating from the vampires as they raced after me. I kept my focus on the path downhill, my heart in my throat as I leaned forward to kick the sides of my horse, urging him to gallop even faster.

  But soon one of the vampire’s horses closed in on me, until we were parallel. Panic coursed through me, but I kept my gaze straight ahead. I reached for the knife tucked in my bodice, but a strong arm snaked around my waist from the side, yanking me from my horse and tossing the knife from my hand.

  I screamed, struggling in my captor’s arms as my horse continued to clamor down the mountain. I twisted my head around to see Matyas’ icy eyes, his grip tightening around my waist. The wolfsbane tucked in my dress and wound throughout my hair clearly had no effect on him, as he reached into my bodice and my hair to toss it aside while I fruitlessly struggled to release myself from his vise-like grip. He steered his horse back towards the fortress, the other vampires continuing their progress down the mountain, and I realized with horror that they must know that others were waiting.

  Beneath my fear, a wave of overwhelming despair swelled. I had failed before our plan had a chance to unfold, and my failure would lead to even more deaths. I could not stifle the strangled sob that escaped my throat, making one last desperate attempt to yank free of Matyas’ grip.

  “Keep struggling and your death will not be quick,” he hissed, his lips cold against my ear. “I can keep you alive for days . . . as we did your mother.”

  I froze in shock, my eyes filling with horrified tears. Had Matyas been one of the vampires who had tortured and killed my mother? I recalled the brief flare of recognition in his eyes when he saw me in Budapest, and rage seized me.

  “Why are you doing this?” I asked, forcing myself to speak through a maelstrom of panic and fury. I needed to push past my unstable emotions and focus. I still had my kukri knives and the stake; I prayed that he did not find and remove them. There was still a chance of getting away, but I needed to keep him distracted. “Radu trusted you.”

  “Radu is a fool. He refuses to see what is certain to come,” Matyas spat. “As are you. We are too powerful and too great to be defeated—as your ancestors learned.”

  His grip remained firm as his horse clamored the remaining way up the mountain path and through the gatehouse.

  The fog had dissipated, and I could see that the inner courtyard, which may have been stunning centuries ago, was now in a state of decay. The stone paving on the ground was cracked and disintegrating; the central gardens had grown wild with long-dead plants. The keep and surrounding buildings consisted of decaying grey stones; their windows grimy with both dust and age. The entire castle seemed heavy with the feel and stench of death.

  A terr

ified young man stepped forward to take the horse when we clattered into the courtyard, keeping his gaze lowered out of either respect or terror, though I suspected it was the latter. Matyas leapt off the horse, taking me with him as he forcefully dragged me towards the keep by my neck, his grip bruising and firm. I managed to keep my arms close against my sides, praying that neither of my weapons would slip out.

  Scores of vampires crept out of the surrounding buildings as Matyas dragged me through the courtyard, like vultures gathering around dying prey. Many of them had the same look of the ferals we had encountered, with unnatural red or black eyes and empty stares; others looked eerily human, the only telltale sign of vampirism their pale, colorless skin or their lips flushed with blood. They all trained their cold gazes on me as Matyas continued to drag me forward, and I heard some hiss Ghyslaine as we went by. They could easily tear me apart, and I could tell by the hunger in their eyes that they longed to. Matyas’ grip on me seemed to signal to them that I was forbidden. For now.

  We arrived at the entrance of the keep and the doors were swung open from the inside by another human, this one a frail woman who also kept her eyes lowered, and I could see that she was practically quaking with trepidation.

  I looked around as Matyas yanked me inside. We were in a massive central foyer that had the same sense of decay as the exterior. The four winding staircases that led to the upper floors and towers were crumbling, the stone walls decrepit with age and neglect. He led me through another set of doors, opened by another trembling woman, and we were now in what must have once been a great hall, with intricate stained glass windows, ornate high vaulted ceilings, and a long wooden table in the center that nearly spanned the entire hall.

  I barely noticed the decor of the room as Matyas tossed me to the floor. I fell to my knees, my loosened hair falling over my face, barely managing to keep my weapons from sliding out of my sleeves. I hastily shoved my hair out of my eyes, going still when I saw who stood before me.

  It was the tall dark man and the beautiful golden-haired woman I recognized from the Langham, who I now knew were Vlad and Ilona. Standing next to Ilona, her arm wrapped proprietarily around his waist . . . was Jonathan. My Jonathan.

  He looked both familiar and strange. He still wore the fine shirt and trousers he had worn to the ball. But he was now pale, his lips colorless, the usually warm hazel eyes foggy and unfocused. He was thinner, and barely seemed able to hold himself upright, leaning heavily on Ilona for support. But most disconcertingly, he studied me without a trace of recognition, only a mild curiosity.

  Oh God, I thought in a panic. What have they done to you?

  “Jonathan,” I whispered, focusing only on him and not the monsters who surrounded him. “Jonathan, it’s me, Mina. Are you all—”

  “He is no longer your love,” Ilona hissed, her brilliant green eyes glittering with fury. Her voice was light and melodious, and even tinged with rage it possessed an air of seduction. “It was foolish for you to come here, Wilhelmina.”

  “Matyas tells me you intend to destroy us,” Vlad said, his cold dark eyes trained on me, as Matyas stepped forward to join them. His voice was older than his appearance, oddly hypnotic and rich, filling the large hall with its volume, and I recognized it from Westminster Bridge. His was a voice and a presence that was used to command. “But you and the Order are far too late to stop us. My loyal followers all over Europe are ready to strike. We will soon be at our rightful place in the world.”

  An ominous chill crept through me as I recalled Abe’s fateful words in London. Strange murders all over Europe, he had said. Berlin. Paris. Amsterdam. Was Vlad right? Were we too late? Would Europe inevitably fall to these monsters?

  Once again, I forced myself to focus. I carefully angled my arm so that the hilt of one of my kukri knives rested at the base of my palm. One quick and well-aimed throw and I could lodge it into Vlad’s heart; but the others would instantly be on me, and I would be dead.

  Where were the others? Had Abe and the human villagers been found out? Had the group of vampires with Matyas already slaughtered Radu and the others? If I was truly on my own, I had no chance of escape.

  “Why did you come here?” Ilona demanded. “Jonathan is lost to you now. He will soon be one of us. Humans have had their time. It is time for a new world.”

  “You’re mad,” I whispered, trying not to panic at her words about Jonathan, as I subtly dislodged the kukri from my sleeve. If I could move quickly enough, perhaps I could distract them by injuring Vlad before grabbing Jonathan. It was a large fortress with plenty of places to hide until the others—if they were still alive—came to my defense. “Humans outnumber your kind,” I continued, gripping the hilt in my hand. “You all will be killed en masse if you even attempt to—”

  “Your mother spoke similar words,” Matyas interjected with a cold sneer. “Do you know how she died? Screaming in agony.”

  “As did your father,” Vlad added, infuriatingly casual. “How appropriate that their meddling daughter will die in the same manner.”

  Rage flooded through my entire body, only this time I made no effort to quell it. My hand was on the hilt of my kukri as I leapt to my feet, swinging it out in an arc towards Vlad. Vlad caught the blade in his hand with ease, his palm going crimson with blood as he clutched it, tossing it to the ground.

  And I was instantly airborne, hurled back against the far wall and paralyzed as he put me into a thrall. In a movement so fast that I could not track it with my naked eye, he was instantly before me, his black eyes burning as he wrapped one large hand around my throat and began to squeeze.''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''Vlad’s eyes were shut as his hands squeezed the air from my throat. I was unable to release myself from the thrall. I weakly raised my eyes to meet Jonathan’s disoriented ones across the room, hoping to somehow reach him, to penetrate the fog. I thought I glimpsed a small flicker of recognition in his eyes, but soon his face was gone as my vision began to dim, and I knew that I was only seconds away from losing consciousness.

  I have failed you, Jonathan. I am so sorry, I thought, as the world around me began to fade.

  But I was abruptly released, sliding to the cold floor, coughing and grasping at my throat as I took in great gulps of air.

  My vision cleared and I looked up to see that Radu, Szabina, Gabriel, and the others had charged into the great hall, with Vlad’s followers right on their heels.

  Radu had been the one to release me from Vlad’s grip, and his hand was now wound around his son’s throat as he lifted him bodily into the air, his eyes filled with hot fury.

  “This ends today, Alexandru,” he roared, hurling his son over the massive wooden table to the far wall with a force so great that it cracked upon his impact.

  Radu leapt across the table, temporarily airborne before landing opposite his son, who had stumbled weakly to his feet, and they began to fight in a flurry of impossibly fast moves.

  Szabina raced toward Matyas, who had backed up fearfully upon their entrance. She looked more terrifying than I had ever seen her; her eyes wild, her fangs exposed.

  “Traitor!” she screamed, tackling Matyas to the floor.

  The great hall descended into chaos as Vlad’s followers and our vampire allies began to fight; tearing into each other’s flesh with their hands and fangs, snapping necks, hurling bodies across the room; their movements as rapid as a hummingbird’s wings.

  In the melee, I temporarily lost track of Ilona and Jonathan as I stumbled to my feet, still gasping for air. But I soon found them. Ilona was dragging the still dazed Jonathan out of the rear exit of the hall. Gabriel rushed to my side, helping me the rest of the way up as he placed my kukri in my hands.

  “I’m all right,” I said quickly, my eyes still trained on the rear doors, where Ilona and Jonathan had disappeared. “I’m going after Jonathan and Ilona. They’ve done something to him.”

  Gabriel nodded, gripping my arm to lead me out of the hall,

but I stopped him.

  “Matyas,” I said, biting out the name with fury. I gestured to the center of the hall, where Szabina and Matyas stood fighting on top of the table. “He killed our mother.”

  Gabriel’s silver eyes darkened with rage at my words, his grip going slack on my arm.

  “I have my weapons. You can find me,” I said, moving away from him. I could see Gabriel’s hesitation, torn between his need to protect me, and his desire to avenge our mother. His rage seemed to win the battle, and he gave me an affirming nod before charging towards Szabina and Matyas.

  I tore around the table and towards the exit, but a towering, wild-eyed male vampire I recognized as one of the vampires from the courtyard suddenly appeared before me and grabbed me by my neck, slamming me backwards against the table. My body reeled in agony at the painful impact, and the vampire leaned down, his fangs exposed, sinking them into my throat. I cried out at the sharp searing pain of his teeth in my flesh but managed to arch backwards, using my free hand to lodge my kukri into his back. He snarled with pain, removing his teeth from my neck as he did so, and I used the opportunity to kick him off of me as I sank my kukri into his heart. He sank to the floor, his cold hands over mine in a futile attempt to release my blade, but I held firm, even as his dark red blood flowed over my hands and his eyes fluttered shut.

  I yanked out my blade and pushed past the blur of fighting bodies as I continued heading towards the door. Another vampire grabbed me from behind, but this time I managed to whirl out of her grip, continuing my desperate flight towards the door.

  A hulking male vampire seemed to sense my intent and moved to stand in front of the door, his red eyes trained on mine in open challenge. My urgency to get to Jonathan was so great that I felt no fear as I charged towards him, only resolve, and when the vampire charged towards me with a snarl, I was ready.
   My stake was already out, and as soon as he was a breath away, I staked him clean through his heart. As he stiffened and howled in pain, I arched my kukri towards his throat, slicing his head clear from his body, his crimson blood splattering across my face and my dress.

  I kept moving, darting over his headless body towards the door, racing into the corridor just outside the hall.

  The corridor was empty, and I allowed myself a moment to clutch the wall and take several deep breaths, wiping the slick blood off of my face with trembling hands. When I looked up, I caught a brief glimpse of Ilona and Jonathan’s retreating forms as she dragged him up a winding staircase at the far end of the corridor.

  I tore after them. When I reached the base of the staircase, I glanced up. The stairs seemed to twist and wind upwards indefinitely, leading to the apex of one of the towers, and I could hear their footsteps as they ascended.

  Hiking up my skirt, I charged up the stairs. But when I reached the second curve, I was hurled against the crumbling stone wall of the tower, paralyzed.

  A group of ferals scrambled towards me from the base of the stairs, their eyes blazing with eagerness and hunger as they approached. Near hysteria filled me at the sight of them, and I struggled to remain calm, searching the group for the vampire who held the thrall. My gaze landed on a stocky male vampire with a shock of ash blonde hair. He was in the very front of the group and appeared to lead the rest. His black eyes were trained on mine, his lips curled back in a snarl.

  I stood in the center of a village that had been burned to the ground. Despair swept over me as I sank to my knees and wept. I felt a cold presence approach, and looked up to see a dark figure approach, opening its mouth to reveal a sharp pair of fangs.

  I was released from the hold as the vampire stumbled back, looking dazed and disoriented; but the other vampires continued to charge towards me.

  I turned to continue racing up the stairs, but they were close on my heels, and a feral launched herself at me from behind, tackling me down to one of the steps. She yanked my head back and I screamed as she slurped eagerly at my still bleeding neck wound, her rail-thin arms keeping me pinned to the steps with inhuman strength. My stake and kukri had slipped from my grip, and I could only watch helplessly as the other ferals surrounded us on the narrow staircase, eagerly awaiting their turn to feast.

  “Hakeel ishta mi,” a voice hissed from further down the stairs.

  The feral stiffened and instantly lifted her bloodstained fangs from my throat, turning towards the source of the voice. The ferals who surrounded us followed her gaze.

  I looked down the stairs. I was startled to see Anara standing further down the stairs. Abe hovered behind her. She was focused on the ferals, who now stood stock still, as if they were hypnotized by her strange words.

  “Mina,” Abe said quietly, his eyes also trained on the ferals. I could tell that he was trying to appear calm, but his voice quavered. “Anara will distract them. Move away from them, slowly.”

  Anara’s eyes did not shift from the vampires, and they remained as still as statues.

  I cautiously sat up, reaching behind me to pick up my weapons. I gingerly got to my feet, gripping both the kukri and stake should they come out of their daze and strike, but they remained perfectly still as I crept backwards up the stairs.

  Anara gave Abe a small nod, keeping her focus on the ferals, and he edged around Anara to creep up the stairs, his face white with terror as he brushed past the immobile ferals and reached my side.

  We turned and continued to race up the stairs. I cast one last glance back down towards Anara and the ferals as we ran, surprised that she had saved my life and wondering how she was able to control them.

  “Anara was one of the vampires who freed us and the other prisoners,” Abe said, panting as we darted up the stairs. “She did that same trick on our vampire guards. When we came up from the dungeons, Gabriel pulled us aside and told us where you were. I am so very relieved that we found you.”

  “Ilona has Jonathan,” I said, my words coming out in short gasps as we ran. I could see the top of the tower now, only fifty steps away. “I don’t think he’s been changed yet. But something’s terribly wrong. They’ve done something to him.”

  We reached the top of the stairs where a small narrow corridor led to a chamber door at the far end. The door was partially open, and I could see the shadow of two figures inside.

  I sprinted forward, Abe on my heels, clutching the hilts of my kukri and stake so tightly that it felt as if my palms would bleed. I shoved open the door, which opened onto a grand bedchamber.

  Jonathan and Ilona stood just outside the chamber on a narrow balcony, dangerously close to the edge. Ilona’s green eyes were alight with hatred as they landed on me, while Jonathan’s gaze remained unfocused. Abe entered the chamber behind me, and Jonathan’s eyes slid towards him, a dark look flickering briefly across his features.

  I took a cautious step towards them, terrified of what Ilona would do next. I ached to throw my blade into her heart, but she was standing too close to Jonathan. I had to get him away from her.

  “Jonathan,” I said desperately, trying to keep my voice steady as I addressed him. “It’s me, Mina. Your fiancée. You were abducted. I’m here to take you home.”

  “His home is with me!” Ilona shouted, taking another step closer to the edge of the balcony, pulling Jonathan along with her. I stilled as she turned to give Jonathan a look that was both loving and dangerous. “He is with us now.”

  “Jonathan,” I repeated, disregarding her words as I implored him with my eyes. He still looked as if he was trying to recall my identity. If I could get him to take just one step away from her, I would have a clear shot. “Please, Jonathan, I need you to remember that—”

  “Jonathan,” Ilona interjected, leaning seductively close to Jonathan, brushing his ear with her lips. “Kill her. Tear out her and her lover’s throat.”

  I watched in horrified astonishment as Jonathan seemed to heed her words and immediately moved towards us. The uncertainty had vanished, and those eyes that once shone with so much love for me, were now dark with deadly purpose. From behind him, Ilona smiled.

  “Jonathan!” I shouted, blinking back tears of disbelief as Jonathan stalked towards us. “Jonathan, it’s me! Mina! Your Mina!”

  “Mina.” Abe was at my side now, his breath close to my ear, his voice panicked. “Leave now. Let me try to reach him.”

  “No,” I said fiercely. If anyone could reach Jonathan, it was me.

  I boldly crossed the chamber to meet him as he approached. Jonathan halted, another flash of confusion flickering across his face as I moved towards him. It was a moment that I seized, closing the remaining distance between us to place my hands on his face, which was dangerously feverish and clammy.

  “The carriage ride down Piccadilly in London,” I whispered, holding his disconcerted eyes. I prayed that this memory would pull him out of this trance and back to me. I could feel both Ilona’s cold look and Abe’s fearful presence, but I focused only on Jonathan. “It was raining, quite fiercely. You turned to look at me and there was so much love in your eyes. Do you remember what you said, my love? Do you remember what you asked me?”

  “Jonathan!” Ilona shouted, her fury barely contained. “I gave you an order!”

  “You asked me to marry you,” I continued, desperate. Jonathan had stiffened at her words, and I feared that I had mere seconds before Ilona killed me and then Abe, herself. I removed my hand from his face, showing him my engagement ring, the rose gold band now splattered with blood. “I had been in such despair for so long. You brought me out of it. You made me feel happiness again. What did I say? What did I say, Jonathan William Harker?”

  I used his full name in the hope that it would ignite his memory, but his eyes remained foggy and distant. Tears blurred my vision, and something broke inside of me. I felt a cold numbness as I dropped my hands to my sides, taking a step back from him.


   I was too late. I had lost someone else I loved to these monsters.

  “Now, lubirea mea,” Ilona said, and I could hear the smile in her voice—the blaze of triumph. “Kill her now.”

  As Jonathan’s hands lifted towards me, I realized that I had no fight left in me. I simply closed my eyes.

  “NO!” Abe shouted from behind me. Yet he did not move, and I realized that Ilona must have put him into a thrall.

  But when Jonathan’s hands came to rest at the base of my throat, they were gentle. They slid up to cup my face, and my eyes flew open in surprise, rising to meet his.

  It was like watching storm clouds lift to reveal the brilliance of the sun. The fog was gone, and the clear hazel eyes that peered down at me were those of the Jonathan I knew.

  “You said yes,” Jonathan’s voice was strangled and weak, but it was his voice, the one I remembered and loved. My heart leapt in my chest with joy. “Mina. Oh God, Mina,” he whispered tremulously.

  The coldness disappeared, and my hands flew up to grasp his.

  “I’ve come for you,” I whispered, smiling through my tears. “I’ve come to take you home.”

  “Jonathan!” Ilona’s voice shot out with the force of a cannon, her smug melodiousness gone. Jonathan stiffened and whirled to face her, remaining protectively in front of me as she moved away from the balcony and into the chamber.

  “Have you forgotten what I showed you? What you saw in your own mind? She has betrayed you! She has brought her lover with her to kill you. Do not let her betray you once more!”

  Jonathan’s eyes locked with hers, and once again, I saw a haze of uncertainty and disorientation descend. I had to get him out of here, away from her.

  As I stepped past Jonathan to charge towards her, I was flung back against the wall next to Abe, paralyzed. Ilona was on me at once, both her hands on the sides of my head, on the verge of snapping my neck. But she was abruptly hurled off of me, flying through the air to land on the opposite side of the chamber. Abe and I were immediately released from our paralysis, looking up in astonishment as we crumpled to the floor.

  Jonathan had thrown her off of me. He now stood opposite us, looking down at his hands as he took in deep ragged breaths, amazed by his own strength.

  Across the chamber, Ilona looked stunned as well, but I did not give her a change to gather her bearings. I shot to my feet, hurling my wooden stake directly at her heart. She dodged, and it landed in the side of her neck instead, followed by Abe’s knife in the center of her chest, mere inches from her heart.

  The blows were not fatal, but dark crimson blood seeped from her wounds, and she grimaced in pain, her face paling even more as she yanked out the stake and knife from the bleeding wounds.

  Abe and I dashed towards her, my kukri already angled to slice off her head, Abe’s knife outstretched to sink into her heart, but she stumbled to her feet and towards the balcony, leaping off the edge before we could reach her.

  Abe and I raced to the balcony, peering over the edge. The crevasse below was a sheer drop, leading to a rocky embankment. There was no sign of her below. She’d vanished.

  “Mina.”

  I whirled. Jonathan stood in the center of the bedchamber, still pale and shaken, but looking more like himself. His expression was haunted, as if he had just awoken from a terrible nightmare.

  I hurried towards him, and his arms went around me as he buried his face in my hair, his thin shoulders trembling with sobs.

  “Oh God, Mina. I thought I was dead. She did something to my mind. I could not see what was real and what was false. It was as if I was trapped in my own mind,” Jonathan whispered brokenly.

  “It’s all right,” I said, holding him as I fought back my own tears. “You are safe now. You have my word.”

  “Mina, Jonathan,” Abe’s voice came from behind us, and we turned.

  Abe hovered by the doorway, his face grave. “As long as we are in this fortress, we are still in danger. We need to leave.”

  “Stay behind me,” I said to Jonathan, gripping his hand in mine. He nodded, and we made our way out of the bedchamber.

  Abe stayed several paces ahead of us as we hurried down the corridor and back down the winding stairs. Anara was still waiting further down the stairs, a group of ferals now dead at her feet.

  “More tried to attack. I held them off,” she said calmly. Her eyes briefly strayed to Jonathan, and I was surprised to see that there was a flicker of relief in her eyes at the sight of him. “Get to the postern gate. Radu and the others are still fighting Vlad and his creatures in the great hall and the courtyard. You must leave while they are still distracted.”

  She flanked us as we continued down the stairs. Once we reached the base, I could hear the furor of rapid movement as the vampires continued to fight in the great hall.

  “Keep moving!” Anara hissed, gesturing towards the far end of the corridor, where I could see a stream of human prisoners hurriedly making their way towards the rear postern gate.

  I clutched Jonathan’s hand as we obliged her, hurrying down the corridor to join the stream of dazed and terrified humans as they fled out the gate.

  I spotted Gabriel, Seward, Nikolaus, and Kudret standing at the doorway of the gate, directing the released prisoners out of the fortress. When Gabriel’s eyes met mine, they softened with relief. His eyes drifted to Jonathan, and he gave me a wide smile.

  At our side, Abe gestured for Seward to join us. Seward looked weak. His shoulder was bleeding and he moved with a slight limp, but his face was flushed with abject relief as he joined us, turning to take Jonathan in. He met my eyes and gave me the same congratulatory smile that Gabriel had given me, and I grinned in return.

  We stepped out of the fortress and into a glaringly bright and sunny day, a stark contrast to the dreary darkness of the fortress’ interior. We made our way down the rugged mountain path that led out of the gates and away from the fortress, down towards a thick patch of forest.

  An almost religious silence had fallen over everyone. The prisoners around us looked as if they were still uncertain that their escape was even real. I slowly took them in. There was a young girl, no more than twelve, who moved in a shuffling gait, her arms wrapped securely around herself, her eyes bloodshot with tears. Close to her, a man of about twenty had the look of someone who had once been muscular and robust, but was now thin and frail, his skin pulled taut over his bones, his eyes dark and haunted. Right next to us, there was a trembling woman whose face was partially deformed, the skin of her right cheek torn and jagged in a crisscross pattern, and there were two open and bleeding wounds in her neck. What horrors had these prisoners suffered? I wondered with a shiver.

  I moved closer to Jonathan, my hand steady in his. Whatever horrors they had suffered was over now, and I felt something I had not allowed myself to feel in quite some time. Hope. We would soon be far from this fortress and its evils. Radu would kill Vlad, and hopefully Ilona had not survived her fall. Their evil would die with them. The nightmare could soon be over.

  My hope dimmed as I looked around. Why weren’t we being stopped? Vlad had scores of vampires at his command. Were they all fighting Radu and the others, or were they lying in wait somewhere?

  Instinctively, I clutched Jonathan’s hand and picked up my pace, wanting to put as much distance between us and the fortress as quickly as possible. But the survivors around us moved at a lethargic pace, still reeling and disoriented from the horrors they had suffered.

  As we descended into the dense forest that lined the base of the mountain, I began to relax. During our preparations, Radu had informed us there was an abandoned fortified village several kilometers away from the fortress. There we would all gather before continuing on to the nearby city of Debrecen, where we would meet up with Radu and the others at another one of his homes. I knew my anxiety would dissipate once we arrived safely in the fortified village.

  “Something . . . something is not right,” Jonathan whispered suddenly, halting

in his tracks. I looked at him, fearful. “Something is near. I can feel it.”

  Abe and Seward stopped and turned to face us, the trepidation clear on their faces.

  “What do you mean, Jonathan?” I asked, my throat dry.

  Before he could reply, screams punctuated the silence. I whirled, watching in dazed horror as small packs of feral vampires lunged out from the surrounding trees, descending onto the helpless prisoners in a frenzied swarm.

  Jonathan took charge, dashing ahead and dragging me along with him. Abe and Seward were close on our heels, their weapons out, ready to fight off any attacking vampires. I unearthed my kukri as well, prepared to defend us against any attacks.

  But I soon realized that the ferals were not focused on the four of us; their attention was trained on the helpless humans around us. I desperately wanted to stop to help them, but when my steps faltered, Jonathan’s hand tightened over mine.

  “There are too many. We must keep running!”

  I heeded his warning, and we continued to dash away from the carnage and further into the forest with another small group of humans, until the screams behind us faded into the distance. I searched around for Gabriel, but realized that he was still far behind us at the fortress, and I fervently prayed that he was all right.

  It seemed as if we had been running for hours when I spotted the abandoned fortified village up ahead, similar in appearance to the one we had left this morning. Several of our vampire allies, who were dispersed throughout the group of fleeing humans, moved to flank us from the rear as we dashed towards the front gates of the village. They ushered us all inside, shutting the gates behind us.

  Once we were inside the gates, Jonathan released my hand, stumbling away from me as he swayed on his feet. I reached out to steady him, but he began to convulse as he stumbled to his knees.

  “Jonathan!” I cried, sinking down to my knees to hold him upright. “Jonathan, what—”
  “Mina,” he said mournfully, his voice strained and weak once more, his eyes filling with tears. “It is too late.”

  And with those words, he collapsed in my arms.''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''Jonathan’s mind was a blank haze; it seemed as if someone had reached into his skull to retrieve all of his thoughts and recollections. Yet he could still feel memories tugging persistently at the edge of his mind, demanding his attention, until they finally began to unfurl like a spool of thread.

  He was a small boy, riding the Underground with his father for the first time, his small hand clasping his father’s larger one.

  He was a young man, seated next to his weeping mother at his father’s funeral.

  He was attending university, seated in the front row of his classroom, his mind buzzing with new ideas as his professor gave a lecture on ancient Greek law.

  He was at a society ball, staring at a beautiful young woman who hovered on the edge of the dance floor. He did not recognize her from the eligible women he had been introduced to during the Season, and he found himself unable to keep his eyes off of her. Though there was a sadness in the way she held herself—eyes downcast, shoulders slightly slumped—there was also a lightness that seemed to shine from within her, an incandescence that beckoned him to her side like a siren’s song.

  The woman was seated next to him in a carriage. They were riding down Piccadilly, and the rain outside poured down onto the streets with such force that some raindrops made their way into the carriage. Her golden brown eyes were shining with love as she pressed her lips to his. Yes, she was saying. Yes, Jonathan. I will marry you. Happiness like he had never known before exploded in his chest, and he enveloped her in his arms.

  He was in the ballroom at the Langham. The woman was in his arms as they danced the waltz. Mina. The woman was Mina. Her presence in his arms felt like home. But he felt a tension in her, a reticence that had grown increasingly familiar. She was hiding something from him, keeping a part of herself hidden when he wanted to know all of her.

  He was standing alone now, and Mina stood opposite a man on the outside balcony of the Langham. Van Helsing. She was looking at Van Helsing, pained, and the bond—the love—between them was palpable, even from where he stood. Jealous heat rose in the pit of his stomach at the sight of them.

  He was having a row with Mina, turning his back on her, his jealousy too great to heed the pain in her eyes, the shimmer of her tears. And then the ball room was pitch black. A tall man and woman with pale skin and oddly sharp teeth stood in front of him. He was unable to move. From somewhere far away, he heard Mina’s distant voice shouting his name.

  He was in a massive carriage, with elegant decorations and plush seating, like a carriage for the nobility of some faraway country on the continent. There were several other passengers seated in the carriage as well. Two men dressed for a ball, and a younger woman in a maid’s uniform, their faces pale and blank with terror. The carriage hurtled through an unfamiliar countryside, lush with forests. Wherever it was, it was not England. He wanted to speak, to cry out, but his lethargy was too great, and he succumbed once more to the dark.

  When he awoke, the carriage approached a looming medieval fortress that looked as if it had been carved from the very mountaintop it perched upon, like something out of a ghost story.

  He was in a large bedchamber that smelled of musk and age, lying in the center of a four poster bed, unsure of how he had gotten there. Struggling to fight off his fatigue, he tried to sit up, but a woman was suddenly at his side, gently pushing him back down.

  It was the tall woman from the Langham. Her eyes were a startling vivid green, her features so fine that they could have been cut from marble. Her hair was a mass of long golden waves, which fanned over him like a breeze as she leaned down close to him. Despite his disorientation, a primal desire stirred within him.

  “You smell like oak and honey,” she breathed, touching the side of his face, and he flinched. Her fingers were as cold as death. “You look just like the one I lost so very long ago. You will be mine in all things. My mate. Lubirea mea.”

  She smiled, and he jerked away from her, his heart thudding with dread. Her teeth were not human. They were long and sharp, like a wolf’s, and he forebodingly thought of the creatures of folklore . . . vampires.

  As soon as he had the thought, she lunged towards his throat in an impossibly fast move, piercing its delicate flesh with those unnatural teeth. He let out a cry of agony at the pain that shot through him from the bite, and a sudden presence invaded his mind. He heard her voice, though her lips were not moving. I am Ilona. There will soon be a new world. You will help us. You will join us.

  She was in his mind. He shrank away from her, this dark beauty who could not be human. He opened his mouth to plead with her, to beg her to let him go, but darkness enveloped him.

  The hours and days began to intermingle, and he soon lost track of how long he lay there. At some point a man was in the bedchamber, standing over his bed, silently watching him. It was the man from the Langham. Like Ilona, his fine features were sharp and beautiful, but the black eyes were cold. He was asking him questions. Questions about London. When he did not answer, for he could not, his throat dry and his mind foggy, the man whirled towards Ilona, who hovered behind him.

  “He needs to be lucid to help us,” he hissed. “I told you not to begin the transformation until he gives us the information we need!”

  “There was no need to wait,” Ilona replied. “He has moments of lucidity. His strength will return to him once the transformation is complete.”

  “That could take weeks . . . months!” the man roared, taking a threatening step towards Ilona, who did not flinch. “Get the information or I will force it from him.”

  From somewhere beneath his numbness, panic flared from the place where he still existed. What information did they want from him? To what end?

  The man left, and he was alone with Ilona once more. She asked him about London, and he willfully remained silent, grateful that he was temporarily lucid.

  “You need to tell us some things about London, Jonathan, or Vlad will kill you. He has already killed the other men. There are many vacant lodging houses in and around London. You have handled them in the past. We need access to them. We need to know where they are. Do you remember?”

  “Why?” he croaked. It hurt to speak, and he had to force the word past his lips.

  What other men was she referring to? And then he thought dimly of the other two men in the carriage that had brought him here, and a flicker of panic went through him.

  “London will be the place where our new world begins. But we need your help, lubirea mea,” Ilona said. The desperation was gone from her voice now, replaced by a seductive purr.

  Jonathan was overcome by horror and revulsion. What was she referring to? What new world? He took in her unnaturally pale skin, the sharp teeth. Vampire, he thought again. Had he gone mad?

  “Tell me, love,” Ilona whispered, her cold hand once again on his face, and he shivered with revulsion. “Then you can sleep. I know you are very tired. You need to rest to regain your strength.”

  Jonathan looked away from her beautiful face. He may be fading, losing himself, or even going mad, but he would not help them. This new world was not something he would help bring about.

  “Never,” he said, and though his voice was faint and weak, the word was firm.

  A long silence fell, and Jonathan thought that she had left the room. But when he turned back to look at her, she had gotten to her feet and now stood over him. The look on her face scared him, because it was blank, though her eyes glittered with a quiet rage, and her blood red lips curled into a dangerous smile.

  “Very well, my love,” she said, her voice lighter and more musical than usual, like a child taunting a butterfly. “Very well.”

  That was when the pain began.

  At first, the torment was relegated to his e

motions. Ilona could somehow make him see things. He could see his beloved Mina, but she was with Van Helsing, their naked bodies entwined in heated passion. Hot jealousy seared the inside of his chest like acid, and he struggled to close his mind to the images, but they were all he could see. Ilona’s voice was also in his mind, her words a quiet taunt. Your betrothed has betrayed you. She is glad you are gone. She loves this Abraham Van Helsing. You see the truth of my words.

  “No,” he croaked aloud, tears rising behind his closed eyelids. “No.”

  “Yes,” Ilona whispered.

  She was next to him now, curled into him like a lover as he drifted in and out of consciousness, stroking his face, the coldness of her hands now oddly soothing against his feverish skin. “She is with him even now. She is coming to kill you.”

  Jonathan pleaded with her to stop, to release his mind, but the torment continued. All of his memories of Mina were tainted, and he could only see her with Van Helsing. They were at the ball at the Langham, kissing passionately, their eyes shining with love for each other. They were in the carriage riding down Piccadilly, pledging to wed. Again and again, they were naked in each other’s arms—loving, hot and rapturous. His Mina telling Van Helsing she was glad he was gone. Jonathan never knew me, not truly. I never loved Jonathan. Only you. How I’ve longed for you. And he was alone here, in this strange place, this fortress of blood and nightmares.

  When the images finally stopped, the pain turned physical. He awoke in the grimy cell of a dungeon, his wrists chained to the stone wall behind him. Ilona and Vlad stood opposite him, and in a sudden flash, Vlad was on him, his cold hands on his throat, strangling him until he was certain death was upon him. Vlad released him, allowing him to take in some air before strangling him again, continuing the cycle until Jonathan gasped and pleaded for mercy. When Vlad finally left the dungeon, and he thought his torment was at an end, Ilona was on her knees before him, yanking his neck towards her. She drank from him, her jagged teeth painful against his skin, and he could feel his life drain from him, making him grow even weaker still. They would then leave him alone for hours—days?—and the chains around his wrists grew so tight that his skin began to chafe with blood.

  The cycle continued like a macabre dance of death. Vlad strangling him, Ilona draining him, hours of isolation.

  “Tell us what we want to know, lubirea mea.”

  Ilona’s voice lulled him out of a black sleep. He weakly lifted his head, barely managing to meet her brilliant green eyes. He did not remember why they held him here or what he had done. He just wanted the agony to end.

  “I will tell you whatever you want to know,” he whispered. “But please, no more . . .”

  His voice broke, and he was weeping. Her arms went around him, and he found himself leaning in to her. She turned his trembling face towards hers. She kissed him, and he numbly returned it, feeling a sudden and intense craving for her. He had been cold and lonely for so long.

  He was seated in an enormous library, where maps of London, Europe, and other continents dotted the walls. Ilona was at his side, helping him sit upright. Vlad stood opposite them, watching as Ilona helped him remember, probing his mind. A long time ago, she told him, he used to be a solicitor in London. She slid a map in front of him, urging him to recall specific details. With her guidance, he was able to comb through his memory, pointing out vacant row houses, homes, and estates in and around the city. He signed documents they slid towards him. Some part of himself protested as he gave them the information, but he could not recall why.

  Vlad’s cold expression had vanished, transforming to one of eagerness, and he looked to Jonathan like a starved and ravenous beast who had finally been given prey to feast upon.

  “You did well,” Ilona said, once Vlad left the room, her beautiful face lit with a wide smile. “You can rest now.”

  He was back in the bedchamber, drifting in and out of consciousness. He continued to crave Ilona’s presence, to want her near him. He no longer fought nor flinched when she drank from him, and he eagerly accepted her wrist when she pressed it to his mouth, whispering for him to drink.

  In his more lucid moments, he realized with an odd detachment that something was happening to him. He was becoming . . . something. Something better, something greater. Something more. He could no longer recall his past; who he had been before. Occasionally, there were memories of a beautiful woman with golden eyes and black hair, but he did not know who she was, and soon the images of her faded completely from his mind.

  And then he was in the great hall. That same vaguely familiar woman was on her knees in front of him. She was shouting at him, her desperation plain.

  “It’s me, Mina.”

  At her words, something stirred on the edges of his mind. A memory? Of what? But Vlad had his hands on the woman’s neck, squeezing, and some small part of himself protested at the sight. All at once, there were dozens of vampires in the great hall, fighting amongst themselves, and Ilona was dragging him away, and they were once again in the bedchamber where he had spent days and nights drifting in and out of consciousness.

  The familiar woman was somehow in the bedchamber with them, pleading with him.

  “Jonathan, it’s me! Mina! Your Mina!”

  But he could not remember her. His mind was enveloped in a strange fog. Ilona commanded him to kill the woman, and he felt his feet moving forward, but the woman halted him with a memory.

  The rainy carriage ride in Piccadilly. He blinked, and the memories which had always been there beneath the fog slowly resurfaced, flooding his mind in a deluge.

  Mina. The woman was Mina. His hands were on her soft face as she raised tear filled golden eyes to his, smiling. His beloved Mina.

  But Ilona was soon on Mina, on the verge of killing her. He threw Ilona away from her, astonished at his sudden strength.

  When he ran with Mina out of the fortress of nightmares, he felt as if he had been torn asunder. There was the Jonathan Harker of London, son of William and Mary Harker, solicitor, fiancé of Mina Murray. And there was this Jonathan. The Jonathan who still craved Ilona’s presence, who possessed great strength and a strange and overwhelming thirst. He struggled to hold onto the former Jonathan, to the man he had been.

  Yet as they escaped from that horrible place, everything seemed different. He could smell everything, from the salt tears of the human prisoners to the coppery smell of blood on their skin and clothes. He could hear the sound of a running creek that must have been kilometers away. He could even sense Van Helsing’s anxiety for Mina, along with his obvious love for her. And he could sense an amalgamation of emotions. Rage. Pain. Fear. Desperation. Desire. And the overwhelming scent of blood. A scent he recognized from Vlad and Ilona. Vampires.

  They ran, and once they were in the safety of the fortified village, the overwhelming weakness he had been battling took over his body. He now knew that he had been transformed during his captivity. He was now vampire. A monster.

  He sank to his knees and whispered his goodbye to Mina, his beloved, and as soon as the words slid past his lips . . . there was nothing.''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''“His human body is dying.”

  Gabriel’s words reverberated throughout the kitchen like a cannon shot. I closed my eyes, leaning back to support myself against the rickety table behind me, unable to stifle a strangled sob. Abe and Seward were silent, but I could sense their horror from their stricken expressions. I was too late, I thought hollowly. I failed.

  After Jonathan collapsed, Abe and Seward carried him into the bedroom of a nearby empty cottage. There, he drifted in and out of consciousness while whispering about the terrifying details of his imprisonment—mental and physical torture in a dungeon, a beautiful woman draining him of his blood, her words enslaving his mind—and I had to urge him to be silent, to save his strength.

  Gabriel entered moments later, and I hovered anxiously as Gabriel and Abe examined him, exchanging grave looks. Gabriel l

ed me out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, where he delivered his pronouncement.

  Now, I remained stiff with shock as Gabriel continued. “He has lost a great deal of blood. He’s begun the transformation. His human body will soon die, and he will become vampire.”

  “No,” I rasped, wildly shaking my head as I opened my eyes, now awash with tears. I had no doubt that Ilona had given Jonathan her blood. If the transformation was still affecting Jonathan, Ilona had survived her fall and was still alive. “We can still stop it. We must stop it. We . . . we can kill his maker,” I added, recalling Greta’s observations back in Amsterdam. “That could stop the transformation from taking hold.”

  “It is possible to stop it,” Gabriel agreed, after a hesitant pause. “But we would have to find Ilona quickly and kill her. Otherwise, the transformation will be permanent.”

  “Will giving him human blood stave off the transformation?” Abe asked. “I have the equipment to perform a transfusion.”

  “Yes,” Gabriel replied. “But not indefinitely. The only way to stop it completely is to find Ilona and kill her.”

  “I can give blood for the transfusion,” I said, determination rising beneath my despair. But I still felt a surge of frustration as I recalled how close I had been to killing Ilona. If only I had succeeded. . .

  “Mina, it took some time for you to get to Vlad and Ilona,” Gabriel said delicately. “It could take us even more time to hunt them down again, now that they know we’re looking for them.”

  “Then we must move quickly. Ilona supplied him with her blood,” I said, shuddering at the thought. “They must be linked, as Lucy was linked to the one who transformed her. We can track her through Jonathan.”

  “If her brother survived the attack on the fortress, it’s likely she went to join him,” Seward said. “We won’t know if Vlad’s been killed until we meet Radu and the others in Debrecen. We need to consider where Vlad and Ilona would go.”
   I realized with consternation that if they had both survived, they could be anywhere in Europe by now. Anywhere in the world. If Jonathan were unable to track her, we would lose them both.

  “To . . . to London.”

  The voice was raspy and weak, and it came from behind us. We all whirled in surprise.

  Jonathan leaned heavily against the doorway of the bedroom, struggling to hold himself upright. Worried, I hurried towards him.

  “You need to be lying down. You need rest,” I said gently, taking his arm and guiding him back into the bedroom. He reluctantly settled back down in the small bed, but intently held my eyes.

  “Vlad and Ilona would go to London. They are going to London,” he repeated, as the others entered the bedroom. “My memory is shaky, but I do remember that they asked me a great deal about London. They made me point out vacant row houses and estates in and around the city,” he added, his voice dropping with shame.

  The room fell silent at his words. Abe had correctly surmised that Vlad was planning to launch his attack from London. It was an ideal location, teeming with millions unaware of the coming danger. I set my rising panic aside, placing my hands on the sides of Jonathan’s feverish face.

  “Let us concern ourselves with Vlad and Ilona. You’ve been through enough.”

  Jonathan’s gaze strayed to the men, seeming to hold on Abe.

  “Please leave us. I wish to talk to Mina alone.”

  The men obliged, though I felt Abe’s lingering look as he turned to leave. Once we were alone, Jonathan reached up for my hands, linking his cold fingers with mine as he pressed his trembling lips to my knuckles in a kiss. I blinked back tears as I took in the pallor of his skin, the bruises on this throat. What torment had he undergone in that fortress? If only I had gotten to him sooner.

  “I’m so sorry,” I whispered, my voice breaking.

  “You’re apologizing?” Jonathan breathed, his hazel eyes meeting mine in abject disbelief. “You owe me no such thing. You put yourself in great danger to rescue me. That woman—that creature—did something to my mind. My thoughts were not my own. Had I been kept there any longer, I would have been lost forever.”

  He reached out to pull me into his arms, lovingly stroking my hair. We sat still in each other’s arms for a long moment; the only sound in the room my ragged breaths and his faint ones. He is here with me now, I assured myself. I had rescued him from those monsters, and I would stop the transformation from taking hold. I had to. I blinked back more tears, tightening my grip around him, as if to prevent him from being taken once again.

  “I remember being at the Langham, and then in a carriage. We were traveling through the countryside, and then I was—” he haltingly began.

  “Jonathan, no. You have just been through a great ordeal. You do not have to tell me about it now,” I protested, recalling his delirious whispers about his imprisonment with a shudder.

  “I–I want to. I fear it is the only way to purge the memories from my mind. And it could help you,” he replied.

  I had to force myself to remain stoic as he told me what he recalled of his time with Vlad and Ilona. The other two male vampires who had come to the Langham with Vlad and Ilona were loyal followers of Vlad, but he never saw them while he was imprisoned in the fortress. He had lost track of the women who had also been abducted, nor did he have any contact with the other prisoners. He had been kept in a bedchamber away from anyone else. He did confirm that Vlad had killed the other two men kidnapped from the ball, and I surmised that the young maid had not survived as well—we hadn’t seen her amongst any of the prisoners.

  I stifled my jealousy as he told me of Ilona’s attentions and her obvious desire for him. I realized that Jonathan had been abducted not only for his knowledge of vacant housing in London, but because of Ilona’s apparent obsession with him, and that was likely the reason Vlad had not killed him. She wanted him as her mate.

  When he was finished, he looked thoroughly unsettled. I moved closer to him, wrapping my arms around him and holding him close.

  “You are safe from her now,” I whispered. “I promise.”

  “I know that this is not an illness,” he said, after a long stretch of silence. “What I saw in that fortress . . . I would not have believed if I didn’t see it with my own two eyes. I–I know what is happening to me. I–I am changing. Becoming like those monsters. Vampires,” he concluded with a whisper.

  “No,” I said fervently, pulling back to hold his stricken gaze. “I will not let that happen. I’m going to kill the creature who did this to you. It’ll stop the transformation from taking hold.”

  “I am very weak, Mina. Even if you do kill her, I do not know how much longer I have. My mind is still not my own, and I fear I am losing myself as I become this . . . this creature. If I should die, or lose myself, what I would regret most in the world is that we were never wed.”

  “You will not lose yourself, and you will not die,” I insisted. “Stop this talk, Jonathan. Try to rest, and we’ll—”

  “You must listen to me,” Jonathan interrupted, his voice strained with both fatigue and urgency. “It is already happening. I was a shadow of myself. You have brought me back, but I fear it is only temporary. I feel as if my grip on sanity is slipping, and my love for you is my only anchor,” he added, his eyes glistening with tears. “While I am still lucid, while I am still Jonathan Harker, my only desire is to marry you, my darling.”

  “And we will,” I said, my uneasiness growing at the graveness of his words, the finality in his voice. “As soon as we return to England, we’ll—”

  “I do not know if my mind will hold that long. Will you marry me today, Mina? Here?”

  His pained eyes met mine, shimmering with tears of hope and anguish. He truly thinks he will not survive, I thought with horror. Did he not know that I would do everything in my power to prevent that from happening? Had I not traveled across Europe to rescue him?

  I opened my mouth to protest, but stopped myself when I took in the desolation in his eyes. He had gone through great agony at the hands of those monsters. How could I deny him this? We were already pledged to wed. If I could provide him with some light, some hope, then I should do so. Ignoring the brief flare of uncertainty that flared in my chest, I leaned forward to press my lips against his.

  “Yes, Jonathan,” I whispered against his mouth. “I will marry you today.”

  After Jonathan fell into a fitful sleep, I left the house to enter the small church in the central square, where most of the others had gathered. I pulled Gabriel, Abe and Seward aside to tell them of Jonathan’s desire to wed me here in Transylvania. Abe stiffened, but remained silent, while Seward and Gabriel looked worried and confused.

  “There’s no time,” Seward protested. “We leave early tomorrow for Debrecen—we still don’t know what happened to the others. We’re not even sure it’s safe to stay in this village for the night.”

  “Jonathan is very weak,” Gabriel added, frowning. “He still needs a transfusion and some recovery time afterwards. Haven’t you been betrothed for some time? Why the urgency?”

  “He worries he will not survive much longer. I’m unable to convince him otherwise. He has gone through such torment at the hands of those monsters. I know the timing is not practical, but I want to do this for him.”

  “Then you should wed,” Abe spoke up, his eyes shuttered and unreadable as he stepped forward.

  “I can perform the transfusion now. He can rest for the remainder of the day, and you can wed tonight.”

  “Thank . . . thank you,” I said with hesitation, a strange heaviness pressing down on my chest at his words.

  “I will begin preparations,” Abe said, not meeting my eyes, as he turned to leave the church. Seward hurried after him to help, and I was left alone with Gabriel.

  “I’ll have the other vampires patrol the outskirts of the village,” Gabriel said. “If it’s not safe, or they scent ferals, we cannot stay here, Mina. The

ceremony will have to be postponed.”

  “All right,” I said reluctantly. “But I do not wish to delay the ceremony any later than Debrecen. I want to ease Jonathan’s anxiety.”

  “Is this what you want, Mina?” Gabriel asked, his silver eyes probing mine. “To be wed under these circumstances?”

  “What I want is those monsters and their followers destroyed,” I shortly replied. “But I have failed in both those undertakings. This is the least I can do for my fiancé.”

  I headed back to the cottage, where Abe was preparing a now sedated Jonathan for the transfusion with Seward’s help. Abe only spoke to give me instructions, and I rolled up my sleeve, holding still while he extracted blood from my veins.

  “We must allow him to sleep,” Abe said, getting to his feet once he had completed the transfusion. His tone was brusque, and he was still not looking at me. “We will see how he is functioning after he wakes. If all is well, you can wed tonight.”

  They left me alone with Jonathan, and I approached his bedside. He was in the deep throes of sleep, and I could see that the transfusion had already restored some of his color. I pressed a kiss to his forehead, tenderly brushing his sweat-dampened hair back from his face, before leaving him to his slumber.

  The remainder of the day went by swiftly. I learned from Gabriel that the vampires patrolling the exterior of the village had not sensed any ferals in the forest, so it was safe for us to remain until our departure the next day. There was still no sighting of Radu and the others. Nikolaus and Kudret had bravely ventured back to the outskirts of the fortress and found it to be completely abandoned. I prayed that Radu had been successful in killing Vlad, and that we only had Ilona to focus on.

  As the day wore on, I studied the other released prisoners. They were young and old, male and female. From their clothing, I could tell that most of them were villagers from the surrounding countryside, while some wore fashionable city clothing. Seward moved through the village, in full inspector mode, questioning many of them, while Abe performed cursory exams on others. A small group of older men and women sat huddled in a corner of the village, whispering amongst themselves, likely recounting their ordeal. Some still looked shaken, roaming absently around the central square, staring at nothing. Others had thrown themselves into the practical task of preparing a meal of bread and salted meats they found in storage cells along the fortress walls, and searching the long-untended gardens for edible vegetables. No matter what their state, they all seemed to be coming back to life, as if realizing that their liberation from the fortress was real, and they were truly free of the monsters who had tortured and imprisoned them.

  One of the men seemed to sense my curiosity and approached to tell me his story. He had left his small village on foot to head into town to purchase food from the markets. He had heard rumors of strange happenings in the forests, but had assumed they were mere nonsense and superstition.

  “Wolf attacks. No more than that, I thought,” he said, bitterness edging his words. “I had a weapon—I could keep wolves away.”

  “What happened?” I asked. “The night you were taken?

  “I felt . . . a cold. Snow on my skin. Three men surrounded me. No, not men. Monsters. Devils. Could tell they weren’t human by the looks of them. Was going to use my axe on them, but they were fast. Strong. One of them, he got me, here,” he said with a shudder, and I could see the scar on his neck. “I thought—I thought I’d be dead. I came to in a dungeon. All manner of people. Women, men, even some young. The monsters gave us bread once a day to eat. Every day, they’d take someone. We’d never see ‘em again. Thought they were killing ‘em. Found out later they were changing ‘em. Making them into monsters. With blood.”

  I closed my eyes with a shudder. Though it had been confirmed through my own eyes that Vlad was building an army, it was still chilling to hear the words out loud.

  “If you and your friends hadn’t come, none of us would’ve lived,” the man said, his eyes meeting mine. “Thank you for what you’ve done.”

  I nodded, not meeting his eyes. He was right. No one would have survived in that fortress had we not come. But had I believed those villagers several years ago, perhaps none of this would have happened.

  Jonathan awoke as evening fell and gave me a small smile, looking more like himself. Abe examined him and confirmed that he was well enough to take part in a ceremony. I embraced Jonathan and told him to get more rest, and left to approach Elisabeta, the only other human woman I was acquainted with here, who had survived the fortress attack relatively unscathed.

  I explained that Jonathan and I wished to be wed here, and asked if she would be willing to help me prepare for a small wedding ceremony. I braced myself for a response of disbelief, even anger, but her eyes misted over with tears, and she pulled me into her arms in a spontaneous embrace.

  “Mina,” she murmured. “There been much evil. We need something happy. Weddings bring joy. I talk with others. They happy to help.”

  Elisabeta recruited several other women, and to my surprise, their eyes also lit up at the prospect of a nighttime wedding ceremony. I handed over my traveling bag, and they went through my few items of clothing until they settled on the best dress I had brought with me, a traveling dress of deep blue silk that would serve as my makeshift wedding gown. Elisabeta bravely ventured into the surrounding forest with a vampire escort, returning with bunches of white wildflowers that would be wound throughout my hair and serve as a bouquet. They adorned the church with various candles, and one of the women miraculously found a chaplain amongst the human survivors, who happily agreed to perform the ceremony. I was so overwhelmed at the lengths Elisabeta had gone to help me, my eyes filled with tears as I thanked her.

  “You save lives of many here. Happy to help you wed your Jonathan.”

  She ushered me to an empty cottage, where I dressed. I opted to leave my hair down, and carefully wound the wildflowers throughout my hair. I took in my reflection in an old cracked mirror propped against the wall. I had assumed that our wedding would take place in a church in one of the more fashionable neighborhoods of London, filled with guests astonished at the fact that Jonathan was actually going through with wedding the scandalous Robert Murray’s daughter, their spurious smiles shielding their disapproval.

  I studied my shadowed eyes and bruised throat in the mirror. I looked more like a battle survivor than a bride. Doubt flickered through me, a feeling that went beyond my unease about the rushed circumstances in which I was getting married.

  “You love Jonathan?” Elisabeta asked, entering the room behind me, her gaze sweeping over my troubled features with concern.

  “Of course,” I replied, sounding more cross than I intended.

  “You wear dark look. Not look of bride,” Elisabeta said, hesitant.

  “These are hardly ideal circumstances,” I said stiffly. “I want to marry him when he’s well, and those creatures destroyed.”

  “Put dark thoughts away. My wedding the best day of my life,” Elisabeta urged. “My husband, I knew him when we children. We grew up together. He my love,” she whispered, her voice breaking. She closed her eyes briefly and gave me an apologetic smile. “I not talk of such things on your wedding.”

  “No,” I said gently, reaching out to touch her hand briefly. “You can tell me about him.”

  She hesitated for a moment, before continuing, “There was an attack on our village. The strigoi came in the night. Me and my Luca ran. We were holding hands. I held onto his hand very tight. But his hand, it fell from mine. A strigoi leapt on me, almost tore out throat. Luca moved him off me. Told me, ‘Run, Elisabeta’. I could not do it—I could not run. But he begged . . . even as that monster tore into him, he begged.” Her eyes filled with a fresh wave of tears. “So, I run. I run and found place in forest to hide. When I come back, Luca—his body was—”

  She dissolved into sobs and I moved forward to envelop her in my arms, overcome with a wave of sympathy.

 

“Elisabeta, I am so sorry,” I whispered, feeling another swell of rage for the creatures who had left so much despair in their wake. “I am so very sorry.”

  Elisabeta’s sobs subsided and she pulled back, looking embarrassed as she wiped her eyes.

  “You have chance to be happy,” she whispered, finally meeting my eyes. “Take it.”

  “I will,” I promised fervently, pushing my lingering unease aside. “Thank you, Elisabeta. For all you’ve done.”

  “No thanking me,” she said, stepping back. “Go. Wed your Jonathan.”

  When I left the cottage, I saw that the dozens of humans who had escaped with us from the fortress were now gathered around the church. They turned to face me as I stepped out of the cottage, their faces lit with smiles as I approached, and I realized that Elisabeta was right. These people had experienced so much tragedy. They needed to witness something joyous.

  I returned their smiles as I moved towards the open doors of the church, where Gabriel and Seward stood waiting. I looked around, but Abe was nowhere to be seen. Gabriel gave me a tentative smile, stepping forward to extend his arm. A sudden and swift pang of longing for my father pierced me. How I wished that he were here for this moment. I set aside the longing, taking Gabriel’s arm, feeling a surprising amount of gratitude for his presence. I gave Seward a brief nod, which he returned with a smile, and entered the church.

  I gasped. The plain interior of the church had been transformed. It was lit by dozens of candles, giving it the appearance of a chappelle ardente. The pews had even been strung with the same wildflowers I wore in my hair, and they were also scattered about the scratched wooden floors.

  Jonathan stood in front of the altar next to the beaming chaplain, wearing a new black sack coat, paired with a vest and trousers that I suspected had been loaned from Seward or Gabriel. He still looked pale and slightly weak, but his smile was radiant, and his eyes shone with love. As I met his eyes, a familiar warmth spread through me. This is the man I have chosen, I told myself as I suppressed my fretfulness. This is the man I’ll spend my life with.
  When we reached the altar, Gabriel stepped back and Jonathan grasped my hands firmly in his. The others filed in, taking their seats in the pews and crowding the aisles, reverently silent. Jonathan and I held each other’s eyes as the chaplain began the ceremony. Our vows were brief and when the chaplain declared us man and wife, Jonathan pulled me close, resting his forehead against mine.

  “Mina Harker,” he whispered tremulously. “My darling. My life.”

  He leaned down to kiss me, but froze, and abruptly jerked back from me. I watched in stunned horror as the whites of his eyes turned completely black. His hands shot out to wrap around my throat, squeezing with tremendous force, and amidst terrified screams and shouts, I slipped from consciousness.''',

      ''' “He tried to kill her!”

  Abe’s furious words roused me from my sleep, and I opened my eyes. I was lying in the same bedroom where Jonathan had recovered after his collapse. The door was closed, but I could hear Abe’s voice clearly from the kitchen.

  “If you had not stopped him—” Abe continued, his voice rising in anger.

  “He stopped himself,” Gabriel interjected. “That’s why he asked to be placed under guard. You saw how horrified he was at what he’d done. The transformation has altered his mind.”

  I groggily sat up, their words igniting my memories of what happened the night before. I was still wearing my makeshift wedding dress, and the wildflowers were still wound throughout my hair. I recalled the church decorated with candles and wildflowers, Jonathan’s hazel eyes shining with love, those same eyes turning black, and . . .

  My hands flew to my throat at the memory. It seemed like something out of a nightmare, but the bruising around my throat confirmed that what happened was terrifyingly real.

  “We need to separate Jonathan and Mina until we kill Vlad and Ilona, but they are not to be a part of this,” Abe was saying now. “We can find them safe places to hide when we return to London. The three of us and whoever else is willing to help, can then focus on killing those creatures.”

  I abruptly got out of bed at his words, crossing the room to yank open the door and marching out. Gabriel and Abe were facing off in the center of the small kitchen, while Seward warily leaned against the table behind them. They all turned to faced me as I entered the room.

  “I heard everything. What happened last night changes nothing, Abe,” I said sharply, glaring at him. “I will not stand aside while you finish the fight I started. Surely, you must know that? Where is Jonathan?”

  “He’s alone in another cottage, guarded by two vampires—by his own request. He fears he will try to harm you again,” Gabriel said gently, taking a concerned step towards me. “Do you remember what happened?”

  “Yes,” I said, with great difficulty, as I recalled Jonathan’s black eyes in the chapel. “But I know it was not Jonathan who harmed me. Not truly. It’s the transformation—and whatever Ilona’s done to his mind. We saw the same thing in Lucy Holmwood.”

  “Your husband,” Abe said, practically spitting the word as he advanced towards me, “did not merely harm you. He nearly strangled you to death, and barely stopped himself in time. It is not safe for you to be alone with him. If we do not get to Ilona soon—”

  “We will,” I interrupted sharply. “We’re leaving today, are we not? Once we meet up with the others, we can take the Orient Express back to England. That will get us to London quickly. Now, I want to see Jonathan.”

  “Mina, Jonathan’s not—” Seward began, shaking his head.

  “I will arm myself and fight him if I must, but I do not think that’ll be necessary. I brought him back to himself in the fortress. I can help keep his mind at ease. Isolating him is not going to help,” I said, turning to head towards the door. I wasn’t going to wait for their permission. “I’m going to see my husband.”

  Abe and Seward didn’t follow or try to stop me, but Gabriel hurried after me, reluctantly leading me towards a lone cottage on the far edge of the village square, where the vampire Nikolaus stood guard. He stiffened in surprise at my approach, but after a look from Gabriel, he stepped aside.

  “Take this. Please,” Gabriel said, removing one of my kukri knives from his pocket and handing it to me. I hesitated, but the look in his eyes broached no argument. I grudgingly took it before we both entered the cottage.

  My heart broke at the sight that greeted us. Jonathan sat on the scratched wooden floor of the barren cottage, his face buried in his hands, his shoulders drooped with misery. I turned, gesturing for Gabriel to leave us, and after a moment of hesitation, he obliged.

  “Stay away from me,” Jonathan said once we were alone, without looking up. “I fear I will hurt you again.”

  “I will do no such thing,” I said, taking a tentative step towards him. “We are husband and wife now. We’ll fight this together.”

  “I–I do not know what happened,” Jonathan said brokenly, finally looking up at me with anguished eyes. “I was fully myself, and so very happy. But the images she put in my mind of you and Van Helsing . . . I kept seeing them, and my hands—”

  “You must fight, Jonathan. Use that same strength you had in the fortress to hold on to your mind,” I urged, taking another step forward.

  He shot to his feet, backing away from me, holding out his hands to indicate that I should come no further.

  “I can sense everything now—even emotions. It is agony,” he said brokenly. “I can even sense your love for him.”

  “Have I not traveled across Europe to save you? Does that not prove the depth of my love for you?” I demanded, feeling the growing weight of despair in my chest. “Did I not marry you last night?”

  “I do not doubt your love for me,” Jonathan said, with a sad smile. “But I know you love him as well. I–I suspected it that night at the ball, but I can truly sense it now. Do you deny it?”

  I hesitated. I now knew that my love for Abe had never completely dissipated. Jonathan deserved my honesty.

  “No,” I said finally, and he blanched, but I boldly stepped forward until I was within reach of him, gripping his arms. “But our relationship has long been over. You are the one I married, Jonathan. You are the one I risked my life to save.”

  “I know,” Jonathan whispered, turning away from me and closing his eyes. He pressed his fingers to his lids, as if he wanted to physically suppress whatever he was seeing in his mind’s eye. “But I need you to stay away from me.”

  “Jonathan,” I pleaded, tears springing to my eyes. “This is not you. We vowed just last night to—”

  “I need you to stay away because I love you,” he said raggedly, still not looking at me. “I am not the same man I was. I will soon be a monster. I never should have made you marry me.”

  “You did not make me marry you!” I cried. “We were already engaged. I wanted to marry you! Don’t let what that monster has done to your mind control you. I will kill her, you will be healed, and we will live as husband and wife—as we intended before any of this happened.”

  “I need time,” Jonathan said, after a long pause, taking another step away from me. “Until—and if—you kill Ilona, and my mind returns to me, it is best that we remain apart. And . . . and I need Van Helsing to stay away from me as well.”

  I stared at him in disbelief, but by the rigidity of his body and the set of his jaw, I could tell that he meant every word. I tried to move closer to him, but he took several steps back until he was against the wall, holding up his hands to impede my approach.

  “Am I to be punished for having a past before you? For loving him before you?” I demanded incredulously. “We have just wed. I will not allow you to give up on us.”

  “You have no choice,” Jonathan said, meeting my eyes with a coldness that I had never seen in him before. “This is not a punishment. It is for your safety, Mina.”

  He abruptly moved past me, keeping his distance as he moved to the door to swing it open. I looke

d at him, pleading with my eyes, but his expression was rigid.

  Furious, I stalked past him to leave the cottage. I kept walking until I found another nearby empty cottage, entering and closing the door behind me.

  I slid to the floor, wrapping my arms around my body as I allowed my despair to take hold, and I began to weep.

  When we departed two hours later, I had managed to compose myself, and my face was a stoic mask as I rode out of the village alongside Gabriel, Abe, and Seward. Jonathan rode ahead with Nikolaus and Kudret, not sparing me a glance, and a stab of pain pierced me at his blatant disregard.

  After my row with Jonathan, Abe, Gabriel and Seward’s curious gazes followed me when I returned to the cottage to change and pack my bag; but I said nothing to them. Jonathan and I were married now, and I was determined to keep our discord between us. I could only hope that he would come to his senses during the journey back to London.

  We encountered nothing out of the ordinary during our short journey to Debrecen, but this made me feel unsettled. Since our violent departure from the fortress, there had been no new attacks, and I knew that Vlad had scores of followers in Transylvania. Where had they all gone?

  I set aside the disturbing thought as we arrived in Debrecen. With its colorful homes, baroque style buildings and medieval cobblestoned streets, it reminded me of a smaller and more intimate version of Budapest.

  We separated from the released humans once we were safely in the boundaries of the city. Some had family in Debrecen, while others were heading to Budapest and other nearby cities. Elisabeta gave me a warm embrace before departing with the others, and I urged her to be safe.

  The remaining group consisted of me, Gabriel, Abe, Seward, Jonathan, and four of our vampire allies—including Nikolaus and Kudret. We continued towards the stables near Debrecen’s central square, where we left our horses. Gabriel led us to Radu’s nearby home, which was a near replica of the one he owned in Budapest, with a yellow stucco façade and surrounded by tall iron gates.

  “Radu?” Gabriel called out as we entered, trailing him down the narrow entrance hall. “Anara?”

  He was met with silence, and dread stirred in the pit of my stomach. We followed Gabriel into the drawing room, where Anara, Szabina, and five more of our vampire allies that I recognized from Szabina’s village were gathered. The looks on their faces ranged from shock, to grief, to despair. Anara and Szabina were seated on two plush chairs opposite the fireplace, and they barely acknowledged us as we entered the room. My sense of dread increased when I noticed that Radu was not seated amongst them.

  “Anara?” Gabriel asked, his voice quivering. “Where . . . where is Radu?”

  When Anara looked up, I saw her eyes were filled with a sheen of blood tears. She did not need to speak for us to know of Radu’s fate.

  “No,” Gabriel whispered.

  Around me, the others gasped and let out strangled sobs of grief. Seward paled, and Abe leaned back heavily against the wall, burying his face in his hands.

  Though I had only known Radu briefly, my chest became heavy with my own grief for the creature who had displayed such kindness and empathy towards us. But beneath my grief, I felt a pang of guilt. If we had never come to him in Budapest, he would still be alive.

  “What happened?” I asked, dreading the answer.

  “We were surrounded by Vlad’s followers in the great hall,” Szabina replied. “Radu saved us. He led Vlad and his followers out to the courtyard. He knew he was the main focus. We tried to go after him, but a group of ferals attacked us.”

  “I almost made it to him,” Anara spoke up, her voice strained, blood tears streaking down her face. “I managed to get to the courtyard, where Radu and Vlad were fighting. But before I could approach, that traitor Matyas held me down. He made me watch Radu and Vlad fight. I thought Radu would be able to overpower his son, but I underestimated how deep Vlad’s hatred runs for his father. I was helpless. I could do nothing,” Anara faltered, pressing her hand to her mouth. Szabina reached out to place her hand on Anara’s shoulder.

  At the mention of Matyas’ name, Gabriel and I exchanged a dark look as we realized that the creature who had killed our mother was still alive.

  “Vlad tore out Radu’s throat,” Szabina whispered with great difficulty. Anara buried her face in her hands, as if she were trying to block out the images of Szabina’s words. “Then he ripped out his heart while it still pumped.”

  “The pain in my father’s eyes,” Anara rasped, her voice heavy with tears. “As he looked at his own son . . . dying at his hands . . . I will never forget it. I screamed. I cannot recall what happened afterwards. I know Matyas released me, and Vlad fled the fortress, taking his remaining followers with him. We buried Radu at the fortress. After this is all over, and I kill his monstrous children, I will bury him next to his Ludmila. ”

  My own tears swelled, temporarily blurring my vision. I could tell that Radu had loved his son, even though he knew what a monster he was. What agony it must have been to die at his hands. He had not deserved such a death.

  “We captured several of his ferals to find out where Vlad went,” Szabina said. “But their minds are closed to us.”

  “We know where he is.”

  It was Jonathan who spoke up. He had been standing in the back of our group, hovering by the doorway, but he now moved to the front.

  “I am in the process of transformation. I am linked to Ilona through her blood. You can use me to track her. They are in London, I am quite certain of it.”

  “Then we must make haste,” Anara said, wiping at her eyes and shooting to her feet in a rapid move. “We must leave at once.”

  “We cannot be rash, Anara,” Szabina said gently. “We planned for the attack on the fortress, and still lost our leader and many of our own. Vlad and his sister know that we are after them. They will have many more of their followers in London.”

  “Then we assemble various groups,” Anara swiftly rejoined. “We can send a wire to allies of Radu to help us—I know they are still out there. They will join us.”

  “We can’t just go to London,” Seward said, frowning. “A group of bloody vampires entering the city en masse for a battle will cause such panic that—”

  “I do not care about the human population!” Anara cried. “They will soon all be very aware of our existence if Vlad even partially succeeds. It was only a matter of time before our war bled into your world.”

  “We do not have the numbers, nor do we have time to organize and recruit more allies,” Abe added, rubbing his temples.

  “Then what do you propose?” Anara demanded. “The longer we wait to attack, the more difficult it will be to locate them. They may not even remain in London.”

  In the space of silence that followed, an idea took root in my mind. It was a relatively simple solution, but terrifying and dangerous. The best ideas are the dangerous ones, Father had once told me. Always. Mister Darwin did not release On the Origin of Species for years because he knew it contained the most dangerous ideas. And look at what happened when he published it. He changed the world.

  My idea, though risky, could possibly save the world. I moved forward until I was in the center of the room.

  “We need to set a trap,” I said. “I agree that we should not confront them in London—too many human lives would be at risk. We need to lure them away from London rather than pursue them like we did before. Jonathan, you pointed out vacant estates in and around London to Vlad. Is there an estate outside of London where we can meet them? Somewhere relatively isolated?”

  “There is a vacant estate in Purfleet, called Carfax,” Jonathan said hesitantly, his features taut with worry. “But, Mina—”

  “How do you propose we lure them?” Anara interrupted, looking at me with incredulity.

  “We give them what they want. I’m the daughter of one of the last human members of the Order of the Dragon. Jonathan and I will convince them that we want to join their side. I’ll swear all

egiance to Vlad and vow to destroy the Order from within. When they come to us at the estate in Purfleet, we’ll kill them. Their followers will scatter and the newly infected will die with them.”

  “Mina,” Jonathan breathed, shaking his head. “That is not—”

  “It has to be us who set the trap, Jonathan. Ilona is obsessed with you. She’s already affected your mind once; it’s not without reason that you’ve fallen sway to her. And Vlad has to be obsessed with destroying the Order; they nearly succeeded in killing him once,” I said.

  “It will not work. You’ll never convince them of your defection,” Anara protested. “Vampires can sense deception. Vlad is responsible both directly and indirectly for the deaths of your parents. You won’t be able to conceal your hatred for him. The Order of the Dragon has disbanded. There has not been an organized meeting for years—it’s no longer a threat to Vlad.”

  “He thinks it is still a threat. When I confronted him in the fortress, he told me that the Order and I are too late to stop him. As . . . as for my deception,” I continued, bracing myself for the reaction to my next statement. “There’s a very simple way of convincing them I’m telling the truth.”

  “What is that?” Anara asked suspiciously, her eyes narrowed.

  “I undergo the transformation Jonathan is going through now,” I said, struggling to keep my voice steady. “I become vampire.”''',

      '''The room erupted into a chorus of protests.

  “Mina, this is madness!” Abe shouted. “You cannot be serious. You do not know what effect such a transformation will have on you.”

  “You cannot put your life at such risk,” Jonathan agreed. “We will find another way.”

  “No, Mina,” Gabriel said furiously. “How can you even suggest such a thing?”
  “You could die,” Szabina added. “Are you willing to take such a risk?”

  “Listen to me, all of you,” I said, raising my voice above the continued protests and murmurs of incredulity. “If we use one of the captured feral vampires to . . . to drain me and feed me their blood, I’ll be connected to Vlad as they are. We have seen with Jonathan—and other humans—that it can take weeks or longer for the transformation to complete. I don’t need to be in the process of transformation for very long, only a day or two, until we confront and kill Vlad and Ilona. We can then kill the feral, and release us both from vampirism. I won’t be able to convince Vlad that I want to join them if I’m not in the process of becoming vampire.”

  “Mina,” Abe’s face was still pale with anxiety, “I acknowledge that your plan is a sound one, but there is no guarantee it will work. You heard Szabina. They have not yet been able to communicate with Vlad through the ferals. Why add even more risk to an already precarious enterprise?”

  “We have already tried ambushing them,” I replied. “They’re expecting us to do so again, and they’ll be prepared. They won’t expect us to join them. Luring them to us is our best chance of defeating them. Once Vlad and Ilona are dead, their followers will most likely scatter, and the ones who have been recently infected will be released from vampirism as well.”

  My words did not seem to reassure Jonathan, Abe, or Gabriel, who still looked worried. But Anara, Szabina, and even Seward, seemed slightly more convinced. The remaining vampires looked dubious.

  “The transformation gravely affects your mind,” Szabina said finally. “It affects everyone differently. There is no way to predict how it will affect you. Even if you are under the influence of the Blood for a brief period, you will have to fight for your sanity. You will have to welcome your own darkness without letting it consume you.”

  Icy fingers of dread crept up my spine at her words. I thought of what the transformation had done to Lucy and Jonathan. Its effect on me would indeed be unpredictable. But I held firm. I had to look past my fear if I was going to kill Vlad and Ilona.

  “I know this comes with great risk . . . and it may not work. But I worry that if we do not stop them in London, it’ll be too late.”

  “Mina’s plan is risky, but it may work,” Anara said, turning to address the others. “Our numbers are small, and time is against us, so we must all be in agreement. Are there any dissenters?”

  Again, I was surprised that Anara was helping me, even siding with me. It was hard to believe this was the same creature who had nearly killed me on two separate occasions. I could only assume that it was desperation that propelled her—she fiercely wanted Vlad’s death.

  “Mina,” Jonathan spoke up, moving towards me, his hazel eyes shot with anxiety. “Szabina is quite right about the effect the transformation has on your mind. Look at what I am going through.”

  “It will be temporary,” I insisted, taking his hands. I was relieved that he was speaking to me, and he did not pull away my touch. “For both of us. Once Vlad and Ilona are dead, and we mercifully kill the feral who transformed me, we’ll both be released from vampirism. Many will be released. I believe this is the best way to end this nightmare.”

  Jonathan lifted my hands to his, kissing them, and I felt a soothing rush at the feel of his lips on my skin.

  “How could I have not known how very brave you are?” he whispered, his face infused with both worry and admiration. “Very well. I will go along with your plan.”

  The feral vampire lunged towards me, barely restrained by the shackles that chained her to the cellar wall. She was petite, with matted red hair and pitch black eyes that were hungrily trained on my throat. Despite her small size, she exuded great strength, and terror flooded me as I made myself stand stock-still.

  I was now standing in the cellar, protectively flanked by Szabina, Anara, Gabriel, Abe, and Seward. Though they were all silent, I could feel their tension.

  Before we had made our way down to the cellar, Jonathan approached and embraced me. I leaned in to him, relieved that he had not kept his distance from me as he’d vowed to in Transylvania. His eyes were wet with tears, and he confessed that it would be too difficult for him to watch the feral drink from me. Anara and Szabina had then pulled me aside to prepare me for what was to come.

  “I have the ability to control feral vampires. They are newly transformed and susceptible to hypnosis—not only from their maker, but from other vampires. Radu taught—” Anara’s voice caught as she spoke her maker’s name, and pain darted across her features before she continued. “Radu taught me how to do it years ago. It only works in our tongue. But the hypnosis does not always take. We were fortunate that it worked in the fortress,” she warned. “The feral will drain you of your blood. Under my guide, it will bite its wrist and press it to your lips. You will barely be conscious, and instinct will make you drink. You will then go into a deep sleep. When you awaken, the transformation will have already begun.”

  I tried to maintain my calm, but trepidation filled me at the thought of the feral draining me of my blood.

  Now that I stood opposite the feral, I felt my courage slip and panic began to rise. What if it completely drained me and I did not survive the transformation? What if I was unable to properly function during my transformation and was reduced to hisses and growls, like Lucy?

  “If you want to change your mind, now is the time to tell us,” Szabina said, studying me closely.

  “No,” I forced myself to say, swallowing back my apprehension as I gave her a nod. “I’m ready.”

  Anara approached the feral, kneeling down to address her in that same melodic language she had used at the fortress. The feral immediately calmed, going silent as she sank down to the floor in a crouch, her predatory eyes still trained on me.

  Szabina gently took me by the hand and guided me forward. I took steady breaths to remain placid as we approached the now stoic feral, who continued to track my approach with her black eyes.

  “You may want to close your eyes,” Szabina whispered. “It will make this easier.”

  I obliged without protest. With my eyes closed, I did not have to look into the soulless eyes of the feral eager to feast on my blood. I could now only hear the faint breaths of the others as Szabina continued to guide me forward, seating me on the floor with my back pressed against the stone wall.

  I did not know how close I was to the feral, but I could hear her sharp, guttural breaths somewhere in my vicinity. My pulse quickened and I clenched my quaking hands in my lap in an attempt to still them. I became very aware of the sound of the feral’s breathing, my own uneven breaths, and the tense silence of the room.

  It happened quickly. There was a hot breath on my neck and the piercing of sharp fangs into my throat’s fragile flesh. Instinctively, I cried out and tried to move away, but Szabina’s hands held me still as the creature eagerly drank from me, and my nausea swelled as my blood flowed into her hungry mouth. Again, I tried to move away, but Szabina continued to hold me still. The time to change my mind had passed.

  I grew increasingly weak as my blood drained from my body, and a lethargy more powerful than I had ever known took hold of me. I struggled to hold on to my consciousness, but I was claimed by an abrupt yet calming blackness.

  Soon, I was floating in that strange space between consciousness and dreams, and memories flickered through my mind like photographic images come to life.

  I was a child of five, giggling as my mother chased me through the house, to the great annoyance of my governess. I stood alone in Highgate Cemetery, my small body racked with sobs as I stood over my mother’s grave. I was a child of ten, seated on the floor of Father’s study as I completed a biological sketch of a butterfly, eagerly holding it up for his inspection. He took off his spectacles to examine it before giving me a wide approving smile and a nod.

  I was a girl of fifteen, hurrying down the hallway, eager to discuss the book I had just read with Father. I ha

lted in my tracks at the sight of a handsome young man with wavy chestnut hair and cerulean blue eyes standing outside his study. Young Mister Van Helsing, Father boomed, approaching him with a smile. The man returned the smile, and a rush of warmth filled me when his eyes met mine. I was a young woman, walking through the streets of Amsterdam with Abe. He stopped mid stride and quite suddenly pulled me into his arms, his mouth gentle against mine as we kissed. Abe and I were lying beneath the stars in a forest clearing, our bodies lovingly entwined, flushed with love.

  I stood opposite a police officer, frantically trying to explain what I had seen, my words catching on sobs.

  Some kind of man—monster—feasted on my father! I screamed. I saw it—you saw the marks on his neck! You must do something! Please!

  I stood over Father’s grave. Abe stood next to me, and I pressed his engagement ring firmly into his palm, turning to walk away from him as he called out my name, ignoring the searing pain in my chest.

  I hovered on the edge of a ballroom, filled with both grief and loneliness. Another handsome man with dark hair and dancing hazel eyes approached me, and I felt dormant emotions stir as our eyes met.

  I sat in a carriage with Jonathan. The rain pounded furiously around us, but my entire being was focused on Jonathan. He was looking at me with hopeful anticipation, with so much love. Yes, I whispered to him. With all my heart, yes. And then his lips were pressed against mine, and I wanted nothing more than to remain in that perfect moment.

  Jonathan and I were at the Langham, dancing the waltz. I felt warm and safe in his arms, and rested my head against his chest.

  I was alone. The ballroom and Jonathan vanished, and I stood in a forest clearing in Transylvania. Ahead of me, I could see Vlad and Ilona feasting on my dead parents, their eyes lifeless and empty, their mouths open in permanent screams. I was frozen in horror at the sight, but my surroundings changed once more.

  I was in the church where Jonathan and I had married, only now I wore an elaborate ivory wedding dress, drenched with my parents’ blood. Jonathan stood before me, his eyes cold and black as he lunged towards me, his lips curled back to reveal fangs.

  I opened my mouth to scream, but I was now walking through a bustling village with a basket of vegetables, catching the eye of a young man with curly brown hair and bright green eyes who smiled at me. Feeling suddenly shy, I returned his smile.

  The young man was kissing me as we stood in a forest clearing, and I was consumed by desire. He pulled back with great reluctance, resting his lips on my forehead, asking me when I was going to tell our parents, when were we going to be wed? I want to be with you always, my love, he whispered. Always. Soon, I promised him, my heart bursting with love. Soon.

  It was night. I was lying in a small bed, and Vlad hovered over me. His cold hand was pressed against my mouth as I tried to scream, and his fangs were descending towards my throat.

  Silence, he hissed, his eyes flashing with warning. Lie very still. You will be mine soon. You will be with the rest of us.

  Outside, I could hear the horrified screams of the other villagers, but I was too weak to move as Vlad’s fangs sunk into my throat, silencing my attempt at a scream, and I could only lie helpless as he drained me of my blood, until there was only oblivion.''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''When I opened my eyes, I was lying in a massive bed in an ornate master bedroom, similar to the guest room I’d rested in back in Budapest.

  A worried looking Abe sat at my bedside. Anara, Szabina, and Gabriel stood behind him, while Seward hovered by the doorway. They all looked starkly relieved when I opened my eyes.

  “How long have I been sleeping?” I croaked, sitting up. I felt heavy and lethargic, as if I had been sleeping for days.

  “For several hours. It is just after sunset,” Anara replied. “What type of dreams did you have? Were there any that may have come from the feral?”

  “Perhaps we should ask how she is feeling before interrogating her,” Abe said, glaring at Anara before turning back to me. “Are you feeling ill at all? Weak?”

  “Just tired,” I groggily replied, rubbing my eyes. “My dreams . . . they were like memories. Events from my past. Twisted versions of them. There . . . there were also nightmares. Horrible images,” I recalled with a shudder as I thought of the sight of Vlad and Ilona feasting on my parents. “And yes, there were also memories that were not my own,” I added, thinking of the young man in the village, his kiss, and the image of Vlad hovering over me, his sharp fangs descending towards my throat. Snatched memories from the female vampire who had drank from me—a life that had been tragically lost.

  “Then you are sharing memories with the feral,” Szabina said, looking relieved. “You should soon have a direct connection to Vlad. We will have to prepare you for when your mind is linked with his. Vlad’s influence is strong, like his sister’s. You have seen her influence on your husband.”

  “Where is Jonathan?” I asked, frowning as I looked around the room. I knew he hadn’t wanted to see the feral drain me, but I hoped he would be at my side for the aftermath, even with the lingering tension between us.

  At my question, everyone fell silent. Abe tactfully avoided my gaze, while Szabina and Anara exchanged a look. Gabriel and Seward just looked uncomfortable.

  “He was here earlier,” Szabina said finally. “He is downstairs in the drawing room with the others.”

  I could tell that they were hiding something from me, and I started to press, but Abe spoke up.

  “Mina needs more rest before you start training her mind,” he said to Anara and Szabina. “We are leaving for London early tomorrow. There is plenty of time to prepare her on the journey.”

  “We need all the time we have, Abraham,” Anara said. “Which means we start tonight.”

  “Mina has just undergone a great—” Abe began, his voice rising.

  “Abe,” I interrupted. “It is all right. I agree with Anara. We do need to make use of all the time we have.”

  “Eat something first. And please let me examine you,” he grudgingly relented.

  After Abe examined me, finding no overt effects of the transformation as of yet, he and the others left the room, and I was left alone with Anara and Szabina.

  “Why did Jonathan leave?” I asked bluntly.

  “While you were dreaming, you kept murmuring both Jonathan and Abraham’s names,” Anara said, after a brief pause. “Jonathan left the room after your fifth mention of Abraham’s name.”

  “Oh, no,” I whispered, my face flushing hot with embarrassment at the thought.

  “Your desires—however deep, however hidden—all come out when you are in the state of transformation. It is like a snake shedding its skin . . . a way of leaving your human side behind as you become vampire. It happens to all of us who undergo the Change,” Szabina said.

  “You love them both,” Anara said plainly. “Why are you trying to hide it?”

  “Anara,” Szabina said with a frown. “That is none of our concern.”

  “Why are you even bothering to help me?” I demanded, deftly changing the subject as I glared at Anara. “I know you hate me. You’ve tried to kill me twice.”

  “I do not care about you enough to hate you. My father wanted to help you—I am merely honoring his wishes. But most importantly, I want his children dead,” Anara calmly replied, not at all perturbed by my words. She could tell that I was evading the issue, and continued. “Do not hide from what’s in your mind, Mina. Vlad and Ilona will sense everything. To truly deceive them you must be transparent. You and your husband smell nothing like each other. I assume Jonathan has not shared the marital bed with you.”

  “Szabina is right—that is none of your concern!” I protested, flushing.

  “For your plan to work, it is my concern. Vampires can smell and sense everything. If you are to present yourself as a married couple to Vlad and Ilona, you need to smell like one. And that means sharing a bed.”

 

“It may be helpful that we do not smell of each other,” I stammered. “Ilona is obsessed with Jonathan, and jealous of me.”

  “Then you will need to convince her that you don’t mind sharing. Our mating rules are not as stringent as humans are; we often have many mates. For the sake of your plan, you and Jonathan are a married human couple on the verge of transforming into vampires who want to join the winning side. This is your plan, Mina. Now you must follow it through.”

  “She is right,” Szabina quietly conceded. “If Vlad and Ilona sense any tension between you and your husband . . .”

  I bit back an angry retort as the truth of their words sank in. It would be quite suspicious if Jonathan and I had any outward friction between us when we presented ourselves to them.

  “All right,” I said warily. “I will talk to Jonathan. Let’s get on with the training . . . I have no appetite.”

  Szabina gently guided me out of bed and into a plush armchair by the window. She sat down on the chair opposite me, making me close my eyes as she put me under hypnosis.

  But as the hypnosis set in, I felt nothing, only a heavy fatigue. When she drew me out of it, frustration swept over me.

  “I feel nothing other than this fatigue. It feels like there has been no change in me at all,” I said, worried that the transformation would not take hold. We were leaving tomorrow, and there was no alternative plan.

  “It takes time. You were only drained and given blood several hours ago,” Szabina said, giving my hand a comforting squeeze before getting to her feet. “You do need more rest.”

  Anara reluctantly agreed, and they left me alone to sleep. Despite my fatigue, I remained awake, still disturbed from what I had seen during my state of unconsciousness, and terrified of what I would see should I fall into it again.

  As I was finally drifting off, the bedroom door swung open, and Jonathan entered. I immediately sat up, giving him a tentative smile. But my hope dissipated as I took in his countenance. He held himself rigidly, and his eyes were once again cold and guarded.
   “Jonathan—” I began, deciding to address what had happened during my dreams. I got out of bed to approach him, but he held up his hand.

  “I do not want to discuss it, Mina,” he said wearily. “Anara informed me that we need to appear unified if we are to deceive Vlad and Ilona. We need to sleep next to each other tonight.”

  He moved past me towards the bed, still avoiding my gaze as he sat down and removed his shoes. It was as if his earlier tenderness towards me had never happened at all.

  “I cannot help what I saw in my dreams,” I said. “They were like memories. You know what it is like—you’re going through the same thing! This isn’t going to work if you treat me with such coldness, Jonathan.”

  I was talking about more than the plan to kill Vlad and Ilona, and I could tell that he understood my meaning. His shoulders stiffened, but he still did not turn around.

  “I know you cannot help what you see when you undergo the transformation,” he replied. “But you forget that my mind is still not my own, and I can still see the images that Ilona put into my thoughts. Hearing you say his name repeatedly has only made matters worse.”

  “I told you, you need to fight. You need to use your love for me as a barrier to keep the darkness away. It is the only way we’ll succeed.”

  Jonathan remained silent, and my entire body deflated. Had I truly lost him? Even if my plan to kill Vlad and Ilona worked, how could things ever go back to the way they were before? The weight of the day’s events—the feral vampire at my throat, my dark dreams, the impending danger that awaited us in London, and Jonathan’s renewed coldness settled over me, and my eyes burned with tears. I turned away from him, pressing my hand to my mouth to stifle a sob.

  But I soon felt gentle hands on my shoulders. Jonathan turned me around to face him, his face grave with regret and sorrow as he pulled me into his arms.

  “I do not deserve you, Mina,” he whispered into my hair, sounding bereft. “Forgive me. Forgive my jealousy. I curse the monster who has done this to us. I will happily destroy her. I am trying to fight the darkness, my darling. I will continue to try.”

  He took my hand and guided me towards the bed, pulling me down next to him and enfolding me into his arms.

  “You need to take the advice you gave me. You have been through much these past few days,” he whispered. “Rest, darling. Sleep.”

  I obliged, my lingering fatigue now seeping in to every part of my body, and my eyes fluttered shut. Jonathan continued to hold me close as I drifted off to sleep, whispering words of endearment into my ear. The sleep I fell into was heavier than any sleep I had ever known, filled with snatches of memory both familiar and strange.

  I awoke with a start. The space where Jonathan had lain beside me was now empty, and the early morning rays of dawn streamed past the heavy velvet curtains into the room. I blinked, turning away from the window. The faint sunlight seemed exceedingly bright, and I realized that I felt different. I felt . . . more.

  I could clearly hear snatches of conversation coming from downstairs, when the day before I’d been unable to hear past this room. Outside, I could hear two street vendors bickering in the central square. I could see every intricate detail of the patterns woven into the rugs on the floor and in the curtains. From the kitchen, I could smell freshly baked bread, the sweetness of fruits, and the heavy aroma of coffee. I could also smell the musk of sweat and the coppery scent of blood from the other human and vampire occupants of the house. It seemed as if all of my senses had come to life, and I was truly experiencing them for the first time.

  Shaking, I reached up to feel my teeth. They were sharper and more elongated than before. As I touched them, I felt a whisper in the back of my mind, like the soft caress of a lover, firm and insistent.

  The end is the beginning, my children. The world will be ours.

  It was a coldly familiar voice. It was Vlad’s voice.''',

      '''“I have never seen the transformation take hold so swiftly,” Szabina said with a worried frown, examining the pallor of my skin and my sharpened teeth. “It usually takes much longer for any physical changes to occur.”

  After hearing Vlad’s voice in my mind, I shouted for help, and everyone came into the bedroom at once. I was now seated on the armchair by the window as Szabina examined me. Abe, Jonathan, and the others hovered around us.

  “Then we need to stop it before it progresses further,” Jonathan said, his voice firm. “Kill the feral now.”

  “Yes,” Gabriel said, practically shaking with worry. “I’ll do it.”

  “I agree,” Abe said. “It is too much of a risk to—”

  “No,” I interrupted. “If I’m hearing him in my mind, I can communicate with him and lure him to Purfleet. We arrive in England tomorrow—that’s only another day.”

  “Mina—” Jonathan protested.

  “I can endure this for another day,” I insisted, before turning towards Szabina. “Do I still have time before the transformation is complete?”

  “You do,” Szabina replied, but she looked uncertain as her vivid eyes roamed over my face. “From the way you look, perhaps two or three days at the most.”

  “Then another day in this state will do me no harm,” I said, though I had to suppress my own trepidation as I got to my feet. The thought of becoming permanently vampire terrified me, but I was determined to carry out my plan. It was the only chance we had and the time for our confrontation was almost at hand.

  Everyone looked trepidatious, especially my husband, Gabriel, and Abe; but they reluctantly nodded in agreement. They all filed out of the room so that I could wash and change, except for Jonathan. We kept silent, but I sensed his eyes on me as I washed and put on a dark red traveling dress that Anara had loaned me from one of the wardrobes in the house. As I dressed, I was intensely aware of every sight, smell and sound—the brightness of the sunlight filtering in the window, the voices from downstairs and outside, Jonathan’s overwhelming scent of honey, blood, and oak.

  “Mina,” he said, when I finished getting dressed, approaching me to cup my face in his. I hungrily took him in; with my heightened vision, he looked even more handsome. His pale skin gleamed like fine ivory, his hazel eyes a vivid green speckled with gold, his mouth sensually full. I could even sense his emotions—love, worry, fear.

  “I know how you are feeling. It is as if the entire world has come alive around you.”

  “Yes,” I whispered. “I can feel everything.”

  “I know it is difficult, but try not to let it overwhelm you.”

  I gave him an agreeable nod, and moved over to the mirror to put on my veiled hat.

  “Perhaps . . . perhaps you shouldn’t look at your reflection,” Jonathan hedged.

  But it was too late. I had already glimpsed my reflection. My skin was ghostly pale, my eyes shimmered like golden fire, and my lips were red and flushed with blood. Though I was not yet fully transformed, I already looked like one of those monsters.

  Jonathan watched me with concern as I hastily turned away from the mirror, putting on the veiled hat that concealed my face. I gave him another nod to indicate that I was all right, though I was still shaken by my appearance.

  As we descended the stairs to join the others, I tried to steel myself against the multitude of smells and sounds that seized my senses. When we reached the front entrance hall at the base of the stairs, I could even feel the emotions of the other humans and vampires in the house, as powerfully as any scent or sound. There was anxiety, tension, and great distress.

  I halted in my tracks, overwhelmed. How could I hope to confront Vlad and Ilona when I felt so deluged by my heightened senses?

  “Try to focus on one thing at a time; that has helped me,” Jonathan said gently, taking my hand. “Focus on the feel of my hand in yours.”

  I heeded his advice, focusing on the coolness of his hand over mine as we made our way to the dining room, where the others were gathered.

   I took everyone in when we entered the room, as I had barely paid attention to any of them when Szabina was examining me. Gabriel appeared to me just as he had before, darkly beautiful, his silver eyes glittering. Seward also looked the same, though his boyish features appeared slightly more pronounced.

  But like Jonathan, Abe seemed even more handsome to me now, his blue eyes more vivid, his wavy chestnut hair shot with gold as it caught the light, his lean muscles pronounced beneath the crisp white shirt and dark vest he wore. I was unable to suppress the jolt of desire that shot through me at the sight of him, and I had to avert my eyes. If Jonathan sensed the emotion, he made no indication of it, taking the seat next to me as I tried to eat. Thankfully, I did not yet feel a desire for blood, but the plate of fresh bread and fruit did not entice my appetite. I still forced myself to eat, though the food was tasteless in my mouth.

  “We have time before the train leaves,” Szabina spoke up. She was studying me with concern; no doubt my struggle to acclimate myself to my awakened senses were evident. “Perhaps Mina should take more time to adjust before we depart.”

  Everyone’s eyes turned towards me, and I flushed. They all nodded in agreement, my husband and Abe enthusiastically so.

  “Wilhelmina,” Szabina said, giving me a gentle smile. “Shall we take a walk? Your husband can accompany us as well. It will be good to get you acclimated to your new senses.”

  Moments later, the three of us, and two vampire guards who followed us from a distance, left the house to make our way down the bustling street.

  At first, the array of senses that hit me were too much, and I felt myself reeling. Sounds that I had long ago grown accustomed to—horse hooves clattering on cobblestoned streets, vendors shouting about their wares, even the conversations around me—seemed to reverberate around me. As we walked, I could hear the details of an argument a couple were having inside a home, the distant peal of laughter from a child, even the whispered words of what sounded like two clandestine lovers in a bedroom.

  A cacophonous array of blood, copper, and sweat hit my nostrils, while every visual detail of the street around me was amplified—the color of the houses, the detail of cobblestone patterns, the vivid blue of the sky.

  “It took me a full year to adjust to my heightened senses,” Szabina said, studying my face with concern. “This is just what you’re seeing as you go through your transformation. If you were to complete the transformation, everything would be even more vivid.”

  “It’s . . . it’s too much,” I whispered, stopping as Jonathan grasped my shoulder. “I don’t know if—”

  “We can kill the feral and end this now,” Jonathan said swiftly. “Say the word, and we will do it.”

  I closed my eyes, but Jonathan already had my arm in a firm grip as he began to lead me back to the house. But I remembered all that was at stake—the human lives in London, Europe— the world.

  “No,” I said, but Jonathan kept dragging me along. “Jonathan. No.”

  He stopped and turned to face me, his mouth set in a grim line.

  “I can adjust,” I whispered, turning to look at Szabina, who gave me a smile that was edged with worry. “Let’s continue.”

  I turned and continued to make my way down the street, taking deep breaths to maintain my calm. I took Jonathan’s earlier advice and focused on one thing at a time rather than allow my senses to be assaulted all at once, and gradually, I felt myself relaxing. We made it as far as the train station before turning back to head back to the house. I could feel Szabina and Jonathan’s eyes trained on me the whole time. Once we reached the house, Szabina gave me a broad smile. She looked relieved.

  “You did well, Wilhelmina,” she said. “You must rest now. Your senses have endured much these past few hours. We must be careful not to overwhelm you.”

  As we entered, Abe and Seward were emerging from the drawing room, and at the sight of Abe, I had to force myself to quell a sudden burst of longing; I’d felt a minor version of it before, but the power of it was so great that I almost stumbled back. Jonathan stiffened at my side, but kept his grip firm on my arm as he led me upstairs to the bedroom.

  “Rest,” he said, his tone hovering between polite and curt, before he left the room.

  Somehow, I managed to rest, quelling my restless senses by closing my eyes and focusing on the steady sound of my breathing, the rush of blood through my veins. It seemed as if not much time had passed before Gabriel had come up to my room to fetch me.

  “May I ask you something?” he asked, as we made our way out of the room and down the hall towards the stairs.

  “Yes,” I replied, with a curious frown.

  “How is it different? I’ve always been this way,” he confessed.

  “It’s as if everything was dull and muted,” I said, after a brief pause. “And now . . . there is nothing but color. But it is all difficult to adjust to . . . like looking directly into the sun.”

  Gabriel studied me curiously before giving me a small nod. When we reached the top of the stairs, he reached out to grasp my arm.

  “Vlad and Ilona are monsters. When one of them is in your mind, try not to forget who you are.”

  “Of course,” I replied, baffled, but he held my gaze for several long moments before proceeding down the stairs.

  It took great effort, but by the time we left the house and arrived at the train station, I managed to somewhat acclimate myself to my increased awareness without allowing it to overwhelm me.

  We boarded the first train of the day to Budapest, taking up several different compartments around the train to avoid attracting too much attention from the other passengers, who would no doubt take notice of so many unnaturally tall and beautiful men and women.

  When we switched trains to board the Orient Express in Budapest, I felt a great sadness that I realized was caused by the memory of Radu. I would always associate the city with the compassionate creature I had known so briefly, who had given his life to help us destroy his children. As I had long ago linked Amsterdam with Abe, Budapest would always be synonymous with Radu.

  The Orient Express was the finest train I had ever traveled on, and Anara had arranged for our group to have our own sleeping carriage. With my perceptive vision, the gilded drapery, leather chairs, velvet curtains, and mahogany paneled interior seemed even more resplendent. I could only assume that Anara had inherited Radu’s wealth for her to afford such accommodations.

  But there was no time to appreciate the luxury of the train. Jonathan and I settled into our compartment, but as soon as the train pulled out of the station for the long journey to Paris, we went to find Anara and Szabina.

  Both Anara and Szabina were in the compartment next to ours, and they separated us to begin our training. Szabina led Jonathan back to our compartment, while I remained with Anara.

  Once we were alone, Anara sat down opposite me, fixedly holding my eyes, and I was reminded of Radu’s intense gaze.

  “When I first became vampire, my rage and hatred towards humans was strong. Radu’s love managed to pull me away from those emotions, but they remained beneath the surface. I felt that hatred when Gabriel brought you and your friends into our home. You radiated with fear, and I have experienced the very worst of human fear. It made me react violently,” she said. Her words were not an apology, and she spoke with frankness. “I’m telling you this because it is rage that you need to convince Vlad. He is all rage—no love. It is what he understands; it is what drives him. I believe there is rage in you, Mina. But you are a good person,” she added, the statement sounding more like a denunciation than regard. “Your goodness makes you suppress, rather than embrace, your rage. Gabriel told Radu that you nearly killed him when he revealed himself to you.”

  I lowered my eyes, flushing with shame at the memory.

  “Yes. But that was when I thought all vampires were monsters, and I did not know if I could trust him. It wasn’t—”

  “Your reaction proves that you are capable

of allowing your rage to drive you. For the next two days, you need to embrace your rage, as you did when you nearly killed your brother. That is how you’ll connect to Vlad and lure him. Who else do you feel anger towards?”

  “My parents,” I whispered, after a long pause. It felt like a betrayal to admit it aloud, but it was true. “They kept many secrets from me.”

  “Good,” Anara said, looking pleased. “That will be your reason for joining them. Your parents betrayed you. In a way, they both abandoned you. What about your life in London? Besides Jonathan, was there anyone you were close to? What about enemies?”

  There was Clara, of course, but she was my sole ally. I thought of Mary Harker, Jane Newton, Horace Welling, and the rigid society men and women who had been so cruel to my Father and attempted to shun me.

  “I was a bit of an outcast,” I said hesitantly. “But the snobbery of London society is hardly enough—”

  “It is everything. Humans have been cruel to you. They do not deserve your loyalty. Focus on the cruelest things they’ve done to you, and use it. When you speak to Vlad in your mind, focus on your rage towards them. All of them.”

  A part of me wanted to protest, to defend my parents; especially my father. But I did need to convince Vlad that I wanted to join him, and any persistent loyalty towards my parents would dissuade him from believing me.

  “Tell him that you know where the last members of the Order are hiding. That will entice him,” Anara continued. “And remember, you want to lure him out of London and to the estate in Purfleet. When you are ready, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing.”

  I obliged her as she put me under hypnosis, as Szabina had done the night before, and closed my mind off to my surroundings. Soon, the sound of the wheels on the train tracks and the murmured voices of the others in neighboring compartments faded into nothing.

  “Search for Vlad’s whisper in your mind. Speak back to him, as if he were in this carriage with us. And do not forget your rage towards your parents and other humans—their betrayal, their cruelty.”
  I kept my eyes tightly shut, listening intently for the whisper I’d heard when I first awoke. After several long moments, I heard it. It was faint at first, and gradually became clear.

  The world will be ours, my children. Make your own progeny. Feast and multiply.

  The words repeated themselves like a litany, and I had to set aside the revulsion that flared in my chest at the sound of his voice in my mind, at the horror of his words. Instead, I allowed his words to flow through me. And I spoke back.

  I am the last Ghyslaine. One of the last members of the Order of the Dragon. I want to join you. I pledge my fealty to you.

  I repeated the words over and over again, until I felt a strange pull, as if I was being beckoned. There was a presence in my mind; I felt it as clearly as if Vlad were seated next to me in the carriage.

  I had his attention. He was listening to me.

  It is I, Wilhelmina Ghyslaine. I have failed in my attempt against you. I have become vampire like my husband. I no longer belong in the human world. They are not worthy of my loyalty. I will wait for you at the Carfax estate in Purfleet. I can help you destroy the Order; I know where they hide.

  I felt a sudden hatred, a surge of maleficence that clung to my mind. I did not know if it came from me, or Vlad, but I held firm to my words, repeating them in my mind.

  My parents betrayed me. Humans were cruel to me. I never should have fought you. Let me help you destroy the Order. Let me help you win.

  I thought of my mother. She could have left the fight against Vlad to the other members of the Order. She did not have to abandon me. My father could have told me what he was doing in Transylvania. They had chosen to put their pursuits above their daughter, whom they supposedly loved. They had left me, alone and isolated, to shoulder the burden of a dark legacy. Hot rage took hold of me as I continued speaking to him in my mind.

  My parents were never worthy of my love. They left me alone. They abandoned me. Let me join you, Master.

  “Mina!” Abe cried.

  My eyes flew open. I had fallen to the floor of the compartment, and I was lying on my back. Abe was crouched behind me, and he helped me to my feet, his brow furrowed with concern. Anara stood right outside the compartment, her eyes wide with uncertainty.

  “Why did you wake me?” I demanded, extricating myself from Abe’s grip. “I was speaking to Vlad. He was listening to me!”

  “Your eyes went completely black, and you lost consciousness,” Anara said. “I called Abraham for help.”

  “I–I’m quite all right,” I stammered, though I was alarmed at her description of my state. “Put me back under hypnosis. I need to keep talking to him.”

  “No,” Anara and Abe said at once.

  “You need to rest and eat,” Abe said, silencing me before I could protest.

  “Then we need to practice separating your dark thoughts from your rational ones,” Anara added. “Especially when you are so close to becoming vampire.”

  I reluctantly fell silent, surprised by the flare of rage I felt at their words. The darkness was still there, and it was strangely intoxicating. It was difficult to resist its pull, and I had to take several deep breaths to calm myself.

  We headed to the dining carriage, where the others were already seated. Both Jonathan and Gabriel rose from their seats when I entered, worriedly searching my face. I gave them a small smile to indicate that I was all right, though I still felt unsettled.

  We took the table opposite them, and Jonathan confirmed that he had been able to connect with Ilona. He had also lost consciousness, and it had been very difficult for him to return to himself again. But he had vaguely been able to make out where she was—a large home in London with an interior he recognized.

  “I handled the sale last year. It is located in Mayfair and currently vacant. It is one of the houses I told them about during my capture. There were many of those creatures gathered, including Vlad.”

  “Bloody hell,” Seward whispered, closing his eyes. “So they are in London.”

  After I recounted my own experience of connecting with Vlad in my mind, Szabina frowned.

  “This worries me,” she murmured. “We cannot risk you both losing hold of your sanity and actually joining Vlad—or revealing your deception.”

  “I will never forget that they are responsible for the deaths of my parents and many other innocents,” I said hotly, offended by the suggestion. “I’ll do whatever training is necessary to ensure that I don’t lose myself; but we must keep connecting with them. This proves that my plan is working. They’re listening to us, and now we know for certain that they’re in London. We must continue to lure them to us in Purfleet.”

  “Vlad and Ilona are powerful,” Gabriel said, addressing Szabina and Anara. “Are we certain that Mina and Jonathan can kill them on their own?”

  “They won’t be alone,” Abe interjected. “The rest of us will hide on the grounds of the estate, ready to strike when necessary.”

  “There is no certainty that we will get to them in time,” Szabina added. “Anara and I will do our best to ensure that Mina and Jonathan know exactly what to do when the time comes.”

  “We’ll be ready,” I said. I looked forward to killing them both; I could feel my kukri knives rub eagerly against the skin beneath my sleeves. Jonathan did not share my confident look. His eyes were shadowed with trepidation, but he gave the others an affirmative nod.

  Szabina and Anara led us to the empty smoking saloon, where we had slightly more space to move, and briefly trained us on the best way to dispatch Vlad and Ilona. While I was familiar with much of what they told us because of the training I had undergone prior to the fortress attack, I could see that Jonathan looked overwhelmed by all the information.

  “You can do this,” I assured him. “Just remember all that those monsters have put you through.”

  “I am unable to forget,” Jonathan replied darkly.

  We were separated to connect with Vlad and Ilona once more. Anara cautioned me to hold on to my true intentions beneath the rage. When she again put me under hypnosis, I embraced the familiar sound of Vlad’s whisper in my mind.

  But this time, his whispers were personal. He was speaking directly to me. Mina, his voice whispered. Mina.

  It is I, Mina. Let me join you, I responded, pushing away my trepidation at hearing the monster use my name. I will wait for you at the Carfax estate in Purfleet, and I will help you.

  As I silently spoke to him, I began to think of my mind as two separate entities. The dark and the light. Vampire and human. I held back my true thoughts as I whispered the lies.

  Come to me so that I can kill you, you monster, my true thoughts raged. Come to me so that I can rip out your heart with my blade.

  “When I first saw you,” Jonathan said reflectively. “You were sitting off to the side of the ballroom. You were wearing all black, which was quite scandalous to the women who sat near me. They thought it inappropriate to attend a ball when in mourning. You looked unhappy, but there was still something about you that drew me in.”

  Jonathan and I were now seated on our beds in our compartment. After completing our training with Anara and Szabina, we had taken a brief meal in the dining carriage with the others. Unlike the day before, when fatigue had weighed me down, I now felt a pulsating energy, and I had no desire to rest. I only agreed to try at the urging of Jonathan and the others.

  “I think I loved you before I even said a word to you,” Jonathan continued now. “But I was such a fool, Mina.”

  “What do you mean?” I asked. With my newly heightened awareness, I could sense the conflicting emotions emanating from him—love, worry, confusion, resolve.

  “To think that life as a member of London society would ever satisfy you, even if it were with me. Now that I have seen what you are capable of, I cannot see you happily living that life. I know this has been a perilous journey, and you have experienced much despair, but I have never seen such passion in you as I have

during this journey. It is as if you’ve come to life.”

  “You think I want this?” I asked, incredulous, getting to my feet. “Vampires in our midst, on the verge of destroying everything? A possible war that—”

  “No,” Jonathan said, fervently shaking his head as he also clamored to his feet. “Of course not. But you are a scientist and an adventurer. It is who you are, Mina. I see that now. Once this is over—Vlad and Ilona dead, the threat of vampires gone—do you see yourself happily living in London as if none of this ever happened?”

  “Yes!” I cried. The dark rage that I had kept at bay seized me once more. “It is all I have wished for—to have things back to the way they were before your abduction!”

  “Being the mother to our children? Hosting charity balls? Afternoon tea with my mother and other society wives?” Jonathan pressed, ignoring my outburst. “Think of it, Mina. That would be your life.”

  “I have already thought of it,” I protested, though my voice wavered, and a familiar dread stirred in my stomach at the picture Jonathan painted of my future in London. “I agreed to marry you, did I not? I am married to you. Your life will be my life. As long as you are in it, I will be happy. This is the last thing we should be focused on when we are so close to confronting Vlad and Ilona. We need to be focused on the task that lies before us—not if I will hate having tea with your mother in the future.”

  Jonathan’s conflicted expression remained as his eyes swept over my face. Unlike the day before, or in Transylvania, there was no coldness, anger or jealousy in his eyes—only an acceptance that made me nervous. He leaned forward to place a chaste kiss on my lips.

  “You are right. We should rest,” he said quietly.

  He turned from me, removing his coat and dropping it on the side table. I knew the matter was not settled, and my burgeoning rage swelled. Had I not risked my life to rescue him? Had I not married him?

  My hands shot out to grip his arms, forcing him around to face me.

  “How can you doubt me—us—after all that I have done for you? After we have been wed? Do you not know what I’ve gone through, all in the name of rescuing you?” I shouted, furious.

  “Mina,” Jonathan’s voice was panicked. “Please. Come back to yourself.”

  The genuine fear in his voice pierced my veil of fury. I released him at once, stumbling back. Jonathan looked down at his arms, rolling up his sleeves. There were red marks on his skin from where I had grabbed him. Shaking, I pressed my hand to my mouth.

  “Oh, Jonathan. I–I am so sorry,” I breathed.

  “That was not you. The whites of your eyes went completely black. This frightens me. I worry for you.”

  “I’m all right,” I protested, more loudly than I intended, and Jonathan tensed. I took a breath to calm myself before speaking again. “I’ll contain my rage. This is almost over. We are so very close, Jonathan.”

  Jonathan was silent for a long moment before giving me a grudging nod of agreement. When we lay down next to each other on one of the narrow beds to sleep, he pulled me in close to the warmth of his body. Despite our physical closeness, I could still sense a distance from him, though there was also the unmistakable sense of desire—a desire which he did not act upon—and his slow even breaths told me that he had fallen asleep.

  But my increased awareness and renewed energy kept me awake, along with the lingering rage that flowed throughout my body. Soon, I could hear Vlad’s distant whisper in my mind, and I welcomed it.

  Mina, he whispered. Mina.

  I am here, Master. Let me join you. Let me help you destroy the Order, I replied, all the while my true thoughts swirled beneath the surface, like a raging inferno.

  Let me kill you, monster.''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''The cliffs of Dover dominated the shore in the near distance, like a massive hand beckoning us home. Jonathan and I stood side by side on the deck of the ferry as it crossed the Channel from France towards Dover. We were finally arriving back in England, but I felt no sense of relief. I knew that Vlad and his followers were here, like creatures who had slithered out of a nightmare and into reality. The day was appropriately ominous—gray and cloudy, storm clouds hovering above, keeping quiet watch over us as we neared the English shore.

  Though I was filled with dread over the looming confrontation with Vlad and Ilona, I knew that it was inevitable. It was the only way to stop Jonathan’s complete transformation into vampire, and to save the human world. There was no time for doubt or hesitation.

  I turned to glance behind me, where the others from our group stood amongst the crowd on the deck. Abe’s gaze had been centered on me, but he averted his eyes. The others were somberly watching the approaching coast, their faces taut with anxiety.

  During the final stretch of our journey, a heavy silence had fallen over our group. Unlike the attack at the fortress, there was a sense of finality to this confrontation. At the fortress, the lives of Jonathan and the other human prisoners had been at stake. Now it was the fate of the human world. I recalled Vlad’s words in my mind with a chill. Feast and multiply. If we failed today . . .

  “Mina,” Jonathan said, pulling me from my dark thoughts as he turned me to face him. “I love you, so very much. After our discussion last night, I do not want you to doubt that. Especially with what we are about to face.”

  “I know,” I said. His words from last night still stung, but there was no time to dwell on them now, and I gave him a forced smile.

  When the ferry disembarked at Dover, we made our way to the train station. To avoid suspicion, and in case we were being watched when we arrived in Purfleet, Jonathan and I would travel separately to Purfleet by train, while the rest of our group would take the next train that departed fifteen minutes later. During a brief stop in Paris before we transferred trains, Jonathan had sent a wire to Vlad in Mayfair, providing him with the exact address of the Carfax estate in Purfleet. While I had no doubt that Vlad had heard my telepathic words, we wanted to make absolutely certain that he knew where to find us.

  On the platform, we murmured our goodbyes to our vampire allies, and Anara and Szabina approached us, inspecting the weapons we were bringing with us. I had my kukri knives, and we both had wooden stakes doused with wolfsbane tucked securely into our clothes.

  “You remember exactly what to do?” Szabina asked anxiously. At our nods, she continued, “We will hide on the outskirts of the estate. As soon as we can, we will join you.”

  She gave us both a warm embrace. Anara stepped forward, taking both my hands in hers. I studied her warily. I knew Anara was not one for sentiment, and her words were characteristically blunt.

  “When the time comes, do not miss, Mina. You miss, you die.”

  “Anara,” Szabina and Gabriel protested, scowling at her.

  “Such comforting words,” Seward added dryly, as he moved towards us.

  “I will not miss,” I assured her, and she released my hands, though her eyes were still infused with anxiety.

  “It’s been a journey, hasn’t it?” Seward asked when Anara stepped back, his countenance now serious. “I’m sorry for doubting you before.”

  “There is no need for apologies. You have been a great ally. I hope this is not goodbye, no matter what the outcome. I would like for us to remain dear friends.”

  Seward looked pleased at my request, and nodded his agreement. I stepped forward to give him an impulsive embrace.

  “Kill those bloody monsters,” he whispered, before pulling away.

  It was Gabriel’s turn to step forward. His eyes were stormy, his body tense.

  “Gabriel,” I said, before he could speak. “Please do not try to dissuade me. It is not—”

  “I–I wasn’t,” he stammered, looking genuinely surprised. “Believe me, I will never try to dissuade you again. I just . . . I wanted to say that our mother would be so very proud.”

  I flushed, feeling guilty for my assumption.

  “She would be proud of us both,” I whispered, before embracing him.

  Abe was now the only one left. He hovered nervously behind the others, staring at some point past my shoulder. Instinctively, I glanced at Jonathan, and he gave me a reassuring nod.

  I approached Abe, moving into his arms without a word. His arms encircled me, and I reeled from the emotions that emanated from him. There was overwhelming anxiety, tension . . . and love. The sense of his love was as potent as the sweetest smell, and tears sprang to my eyes. We just held each other for a moment, quietly reveling in the emotions that we both felt but did not speak aloud, even now. When we finally broke apart, Abe met my eyes.

  “Mina,” he began. It seemed as if there was much he wanted to say, but he murmured just two words. “Stay alive.”

  The same words I had whispered to him after the train derailment, but now they seemed to mean so much more, seemed to carry so much weight.

  “You too,” I whispered.

  Abe’s eyes shifted away from mine, shadowing briefly as they focused on something behind me.

  “You should leave. Your husband is waiting.”

  I turned. Jonathan was standing with the others, pointedly not looking at either of us. I gave Abe one last look, reaching out to clasp his hand, before stepping away to join Jonathan. Jonathan took my hand in his, and we approached the train bound for Purfleet.

  When our train pulled away from the station, I turned to watch our group of humans and vampires, who stood on the platform watching us leave. Abe stood separately from the others, his eyes locking with mine and holding them until he faded completely from view, and his words still echoed in my mind. Stay alive.

  When we arrived at the station in Purfleet, the carriage we had arranged for was waiting for us. Our driver, a man in his fifties with a thin mouth, craggy nose and permanently squinted eyes, took in the pallor of our skin and our worried expressions with so much suspicion that I feared he’d refuse to take us to our destination.
    But he did, driving us away from the station and into Purfleet in silence. Purfleet was a quaint town, filled with medieval chalk quarries dotted with winding walkways for visitors, scenic gardens, old seventeenth century buildings, and modern tearooms and hotels for visiting tourists from London. But I could hardly focus on the pleasant sights of the town. My heart pounded with anxiety, my hands trembled in my lap, and my breathing was labored. What if Vlad and Ilona were not at the estate? What if they were? Were we truly prepared to kill them on our own?

  “Breathe, Mina,” Jonathan whispered at my side, giving my hand a squeeze, though he also looked petrified, and his hand trembled over mine.

  I obliged him, and by the time we reached the outskirts of town, I had managed to steady my breathing. The carriage approached a solitary medieval estate that towered at the far end of a long, dusty path. The estate looked as if it had been in disuse for centuries; its brick façade crumbling, the hedges that lined it overgrown, and the surrounding grounds teemed with grasses that had grown wild.

  Our driver instinctively seemed to know that danger lay ahead. He abruptly stopped the carriage a dozen yards away from the path that led to the estate’s massive front doors.

  “I’ll leave yer ‘ere,” he said stubbornly, as if expecting us to argue.

  “All right,” Jonathan said, his polite tone belying the tension on his face, and he took my hand as we stepped out of the carriage. As soon as we were out, the driver immediately sped away, casting us one last uneasy glance over his shoulder.

  Once he was gone, Jonathan tightened his hand over mine, lowering his voice.

  “If it becomes necessary, Mina, save yourself. Do you understand?”

  “If it becomes necessary, I will save us both.”

  Jonathan scowled at my response but he did not argue, and kept my hand in his as we turned to head towards the estate. As we made our way down the dusty path, I scanned the dirty cracked windows of the estate to see if anyone observed our approach. But they were empty. The estate appeared to be completely abandoned. Despite my apprehension, I prayed that Vlad and Ilona were inside. Our plan would fail if they were still in London, or had suspected our true intentions.

  When we reached the front double doors, I felt for one of my kukri knives beneath my sleeves, ready to strike if necessary. Jonathan reached out to open the unlocked door, and I held my breath.

  The door swung open to a cavernous entrance hall, which must have been grand in its day, but now the wooden floors and vaulted ceilings were scratched and decrepit with age. An inner hall on our right led to a set of rickety stairs, but we moved past it to cautiously move forward, stepping into the first room on our left.

  It was a large room that I assumed had once been a drawing room, barren of any furniture and dominated by a sizable window on the opposite end, providing a clear view of the forests that lined the estate’s grounds. The oak-paneled walls and fireplace ornately decorated with fine carvings hinted at the gilded room this must have once been.

  I entered further, looking around. It was the perfect place to meet Vlad and Ilona. It was close to the front doors, the large window gave us another escape option, and there was a door to close us all in. I prayed that they weren’t lying in wait in one of the many other empty rooms of the estate. We were not prepared for an ambush. I used my increased awareness to listen or smell for any other presence in the house. I heard nothing, but I did smell the overwhelming scent of coppery blood.

  I stiffened at the scent, recalling something Jonathan had told me just that morning. They smell like blood, he had whispered, looking haunted. Vampires smell like rage and blood.

  “We can wait for Vlad and Ilona here,” Jonathan said abruptly, before I could tell him what I had sensed, his voice abnormally loud. “If any of our former allies follow us, we will kill them where they stand.”

  I froze, horror racing through me at his words, until I met his eyes and felt his emotions, which screamed with alarm. He was warning me. His hand twitched ever so slightly, gesturing towards the hall outside of the drawing room. We are not alone, his eyes told me.

  Someone else was here, and they were listening.

  “They would be foolish to do such a thing,” I replied, holding his eyes to show him that I understood. “They chose not to join us.”

  “I’m glad we are in agreement,” Jonathan said, looking relieved that I had caught on.

  My hands trembled as I turned away from him, subtly feeling for my weapons beneath the sleeves and bodice of my dress. Who was watching us? Vlad? Ilona? One of their followers? Regardless of who it was, I knew that I needed to appear calm and resolute. I did not want our voyeur to see my unease, so I kept my eyes focused on the window and away from the door, anxiously waiting for whomever it was to show themselves.

  Outside, I could vaguely make out distant figures in the trees that lined the grounds of the estate, and I felt a rush of relief. Abe and the others were here. We weren’t alone. I had to will my excitement away, schooling my features into an expression of detached calm.

  Behind me, I felt an increased tension from Jonathan, and the sensation of multiple icy eyes on my skin. Praying that my face was an unreadable mask, I turned.

  A group of ten vampires entered the drawing room, their furious gazes mostly pinned on me, and though they did not speak, I felt the hiss of Ghyslaine in my mind. Though I was not wholly surprised at the presence of other vampires, and we had anticipated this—Vlad would not be foolish enough to come here without protection—I did feel a fissure of alarm. It was crucial that we get the other vampires to leave.

  Vlad and Ilona were the last ones to enter. It was eerie to me how human they appeared. Vlad looked like an upper-class English gentleman, with his fine black sack-coat, grey vest and trousers; Ilona a society wife in her midnight blue silk dress. Their dark beauty was the only thing that set them apart from most humans—that and the glittering eyes that shone with suspicion and hatred as they settled on me. Monsters in human skin, I thought, recalling Gijs’ words. These two creatures were responsible for scores of deaths; including the death of my parents.

  But I held my hatred for them at bay, hoping that I looked appropriately reverent as they stepped forward, and forced myself not to flinch at their approach.

  Before Jonathan or I could speak, Ilona reached out to grab me by neck, lurching me towards her, her lips curled back to reveal her fangs.

  “Jonathan is bound to me. I knew he would come back to his maker,” she hissed, as I fruitlessly struggled to release myself from her grip. “My brother tells me you wish to join us. I think you are full of lies.”

  I watched in mute horror as she swiftly lowered her other hand towards my chest, going directly for my heart. She was going to kill me. I tried desperately to yank myself away from her, but she was far too strong, and Jonathan cried out in alarm, reaching out to attempt to stop her, but it was Vlad who yanked her away from me.

  “Not yet, Ilona!”

  “I will not listen to her lies!” Ilona snarled, stepping away from her brother to glare at me. “You are a fool to trust her!”

  “All that I have told you is true,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. I held onto the black rage that had recently become a part of me, allowing it to color my words as I reverently sank down to my knees. At my side, Jonathan followed suit. “Both of my parents lied to me for my entire life. They betrayed and abandoned me,” I continued, quaking with fury as I thought of their treachery. “I have never truly belonged to the human world, I bear it no loyalty. My dear husband is becoming vampire; I have chosen to join him. To join you.”

  Though my words were lies, the rage behind them were real, and I hoped that they could sense it.

  “Tell me what I want to know, and perhaps I will believe you. Tell me where the surviving members of the Order of the Dragon hide,” Vlad said, his dark eyes trained intently on me, reminding me much of his father, though his held no traces of warmth or humanity.


   I drew myself rigid, my eyes sliding to the other vampires as Jonathan and I climbed back to our feet. They were now regarding me with varying looks of suspicion, surprise, and lingering rage.

  “I will only tell you and your sister. This is not information for them,” I said, gesturing towards the other vampires.

  “You are not in the position to make demands!” Ilona spat, taking a threatening step towards me, but Jonathan moved protectively in front of me.

  “Trust needs to be earned on both sides. You both are far stronger than the two of us. We will feel safer delivering this information to you alone,” he said, his tone decidedly lawyerly and matter of fact, though I could sense his underlying panic.

  Vlad’s eyes met mine for several long moments, and I evenly held them, keeping my mind clear.

  “I could make you tell me,” he said silkily. “We have our ways. I am sure that Jonathan remembers.”

  “You do not have the time,” I said boldly, as Jonathan stiffened at my side, feigning bravery even as terror shot through me at the thought of being tortured at their hands. “You are very close to striking in London. I know that the members of the Order are trying to stop you even now as we speak. My information can help you rid yourself of them.”

  I saw a brief flare of rage in his eyes at my defiance. Next to me, Jonathan stood rigidly, his body vibrating with anticipation. He was expecting Vlad to strike, but to my great relief, Vlad turned to gesture the other vampires out of the room.

  As I watched them file out, the weapons beneath my clothes began to burn against my skin, as if they had somehow come to life and were aching to be buried in the flesh of the monsters before us. We just needed to get close enough to them both and strike at the same time, as we’d practiced. I could feel Jonathan’s continued tension; he was like a coiled snake prepared to strike. He was ready.

  Once we were alone, my lips curved in a sly smile, and I moved slowly towards Vlad, as Jonathan moved towards Ilona. Vlad remained stock still, his eyes intent on mine, searching for any traces of deception. Ilona looked as if she were going to launch herself at me at any moment, her eyes shifting from me to Jonathan with suspicion.

  “Now,” Vlad hissed. “Tell me, or I will kill you where you stand.”

  “The surviving members of the Order are in Constantinople,” I said, reciting the information that Anara and Szabina had given me that morning. “That is where they are trying to recruit more followers to destroy you. There are also a dozen members in London right now, trying to prevent your attack.”

  I nearly screamed as Vlad moved towards me in a flash, his cold hands pressed to the sides of my face, tilting my face up to his. He was searching my mind now. I could feel his presence there, like insects crawling beneath my skin, and I willed the rage to course through me, to keep my mind clear, to not flinch. If he sensed any sliver of deception, I was dead.

  After a long and charged moment, he seemed to relax, and his dark eyes went alight with a monstrous hunger.

  He believed me. It was time to strike.

  “Do you trust me now, Master?” I whispered, angling my arm so that my kukri knife could slide into the palm of my hand. “We kill them, and we wipe out the last threat to you.”

  But there were sudden shouts of alarm from the entrance hall—it was the other vampires.

  “There are others here!”

  “She has betrayed you, Master!”

  “The Order is here!”

  Abe and the others, I realized, panicked. They had been seen.

  I heard the front doors crash open, and the mingled scents of Abe and others from our group wafted in. Immediately, the sound of scurrying bodies, snarls, and grunts filled the hall as they began to fight Vlad’s vampires.

  I was momentarily frozen with terror as Vlad’s expression shifted from hunger to an animalistic rage. He was going to kill me. I had to act now.

  Moving faster than I thought was even possible, I lifted my kukri and sank the blade into the base of his throat. Dark blood seeped from the gaping wound as I yanked it out, and he stumbled back with a surprised and agonized howl. I raised the blade to sink it into his chest, but he reached out to grab my wrist, his grip so tight that my bones cracked, and as I screamed in pain, I was suddenly in the air, hurled back against the far wall with such force that I nearly lost consciousness, and the room blurred around me.

  Out of the corner of my eye, I could dimly see that Jonathan had managed to sink his stake into the side of Ilona’s throat, but she now had him pinned to the ground, her face savage with fury as she choked the life from him.

  Dazed, my entire body aching with agony, I struggled to get to my feet, but Vlad was instantly in front of me, lifting me up in the air with his hand on my throat, his eyes filled with blazing fury.

  “Even if you had succeeded, this does not end with me,” he snarled. “I will finish your traitorous line.”

  He yanked me down towards him, sinking his fangs into my throat. I screamed, but he held me still as he drank from me, draining me of my blood. I would soon lose consciousness. Think of something, I thought frantically. Think.

  But my mind grew increasingly hazy as I was drained, and the edges of my vision began to blur and turn black. There was one last thing I could try—it was the only way I would survive. I felt a miniscule flicker of relief when I saw that he was looking at me as he drank. I weakly met his eyes, probing his mind.

  I was stumbling through a forest, dizzy and weak. The flesh of my face and torso was ragged and torn by the cut of their traitorous knives; I was coated with their blood and my own. I sank to my knees and began to crawl, my rage paired with an equal amount of despair. I needed blood or I would die, and I could not allow myself to die. I was the most powerful creature in the world—the Dracula. I had to find a way. But I was too weak to continue moving, and fell onto my bleeding torso, my life’s essence draining from me.

  I was released as Vlad dropped me and stumbled back, his lips stained with my blood. I swayed weakly, barely able to hold myself upright as my vision swam. Vlad stumbled to his knees, looking ill. Ilona was preoccupied with Jonathan, who had somehow managed to scramble out from beneath her, and she now had him pinned him against the wall.

  My hold on consciousness was slipping. I had to strike with my little remaining strength. It would be the last thing I did before leaving this world.

  With my vision still blurred and my limbs keening with pain, I managed to reach down into my bodice, yanking out a wooden stake. Vlad’s eyes were shut, his hands on his head as he shook violently. I had the perfect angle. The perfect opportunity.

  I lifted my arm and launched the stake towards his chest.

  You cannot miss, Anara had said. You miss, you die.

  Time seemed to stand still as the stake flew from my hand and sailed through the air, landing solidly in the center of his chest—right in his heart. Vlad’s bellow of pain and fury seemed to shake the entire room, and as his eyes flew open, I removed my other kukri from my sleeve.

  This was it. I had no more strength left after this. I hurled the kukri, arching it towards his neck. My eyes met his, and I hoped that he could hear the words that I screamed in my mind, words that I was too weak to speak aloud.

  For my parents. Arthur. Lucy. Radu. And scores of other innocent souls.

  The blade careened through the air, and when it arrived at its destination, it tore right through the tenuous flesh of Vlad’s throat, severing his head from his body, and he fell lifelessly onto the floor.

  “NO!”

  Ilona’s agonized wail pierced the silence, and she launched herself off of Jonathan and towards me, her eyes wild with grief and rage. I stumbled to my knees, too weak to stand or fight, feeling a strangely calm acceptance of my death. Jonathan lay still on the floor behind her, his eyes closed, his chest unmoving. I allowed myself a brief moment of grief for him before meeting Ilona’s ferocious eyes. I would go bravely to my death.

  Her face was streaked with bl

oody tears, and when she reached me, she lowered her hand towards my chest. She was going to rip my heart out, and this time she would succeed.

  But she abruptly stiffened as a wooden stake jutted through her chest from behind, her eyes widening in shock and agony. My eyes weakly lifted, and I saw Abe standing behind her. He hurled a knife that lodged solidly in the back of her skull. I watched in a daze as her skin desiccated before my eyes; the pale smooth skin wrinkling, the green eyes turning black, blood seeping from the sockets of her eyes, her nose, her mouth; her true monstrousness finally revealed beneath the shield of her beauty. She slumped sideways to the floor, still and silent.

  The others raced into the room behind Abe. In the hallway outside, I could dimly see the dead bodies of the vampires who had come with Vlad and Ilona.

  Abe and Gabriel dashed towards me. I was too weak to hear the words they shouted, which seemed so very far away. Abe lifted me in his arms, racing out of the drawing room.

  “Burn it down!” someone—Seward?—shouted, and I could smell smoke as Abe dashed with me down the entrance hall and out of the estate.

  He kept running until we were on the far edge of the estate grounds, near the towering trees. The world around me had become increasingly dim, and I felt as if I stood on the precipice of consciousness, teetering on the edge, and I had no strength to remain upright.

  Abe stumbled to his knees, setting me down on the ground, his face filled with panic and anguish. He was shouting, but I could only faintly hear his words.

  “She is dying! We need help! Mina, my heart, stay with me. Please. Please.”

  He began to weep as he gazed into my fluttering eyes. I held them, those eyes that I knew and loved so well, glad that they would be the last thing I saw before departing, and I welcomed the darkness that claimed me.''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''A black void surrounded me.
   In the far distance, I could hear the vague murmur of voices, faint as whispers. I felt a powerful yearning to draw closer to them, but I could not move, and the voices continued to drift in and out of my awareness like the ebb and flow of a tide on a faraway shore. I willed myself to concentrate, to hone in on the voices, until one particular voice seemed to rise above the others. It was deeply familiar, and I clung to the steady rise and fall of its cadence, until the words it spoke became clear.

  “Robert once told me that he hoped I would always look out for you. He was quite perceptive. I think he knew I loved you before I did. He always had a way of seeing—”

  The words faded back into that distant murmur, becoming unrecognizable once more. I desperately wanted to cry out for the voice to return, to not leave me alone in this place. But more familiar voices came into clarity, and I clung to them like a lifeline.

  “You told your first governess you’d no reason ta learn embroidery—you were goin’ ta be a scientist li’ your father. You made ‘a cry . . . ’n you were just a lass o’ ten. Any other parent would’ve been furious, but Robert was only amused. After your third governess quit, he hired your first science tutor. Oh, Mina,” the voice continued, beginning to quiver. “Your father’d not want you ta drift away so soon. You’ll see your parents again one day, but not yet. Come back t’ us, bairn.”

  “I never should have allowed you to take on those monsters,” a different voice said. “I’m unworthy of you, of your love. Mina, I vow to give you your freedom, to allow you to live the life you were always meant to lead, if only you would open your eyes again,” the voice broke, dissolving into heartbreaking sobs.

  I wanted to respond, but I was paralyzed in the darkness, and silence surrounded me once more. I tried to seek out more voices in the deafening quiet, and I soon heard another familiar voice.

  “I was quite lonely as a child,” the voice said. “I . . . hated what I was. I desperately longed to be human, and I was envious of you. You got to live with our mother, you knew your father, and you were so loved by them. My envy was so great that I did not want to watch over you, but I made her a promise. I am glad that I did. I am glad that I came to know you. Sister, you are stronger than most. Do not succumb to the darkness. Do what you do best. Fight, Mina. Fight.”

  “I never wanted to marry,” that first familiar voice spoke again, the one that initially brought me out of the blackness. This time, I willed myself to hold on to it, to use it as an anchor to pull me from this dark abyss. “I could tell that my parents never loved each other, they just did what was required of them. My life was to be dedicated to study, teaching, and scientific experimentation. But then I met you, and everything changed. I . . . I love you so, Mina. Even after you broke my heart, I never stopped. Even when I learned you were engaged to Jonathan. Even after you married him. Even now. I will never stop, though I know that I must love you from afar,” the voice continued, now strained with tears. “I love you. Please, come back to me. Come back.”

  I continued to cling to the voice, and realized that I could now feel. There was a firm grip on my hand, a hot breath close to my ear. I continued to hold onto the sensations, until I could hear the distant rumble of footsteps and voices, birds chirping outside of a window. I felt the cool air of a room, and a dull pain in my wrist, my ribs, my back.

  The darkness dissipated, and I opened my eyes.

  I was in a hospital room, lying in bed. There were bandages wrapped around my torso beneath my gown, and around my wrist. Abe sat at my bedside, one hand clutching mine, the other hand covering his face as he silently wept.

  My senses were no longer heightened. Everything seemed muted now, like vibrant colors reduced to gray. But I felt relief. It meant I was no longer undergoing the transformation, and I was fully human again.

  It took great effort, but I managed to squeeze his hand with my own. He stiffened, lowering his hand from his face as his tearful blue eyes met mine.

  “Mina,” he whispered, the dark shadow lifting from his visage, his eyes going wide with both astonishment and relief.

  I managed to give him a shaky smile, and he reached out to pull me into a gentle embrace, weeping openly now. Though my body was still sore and aching, I clung to him, flooded with relief and love. I buried my face in the crook of his neck, breathing him in, grateful to be out of the darkness.

  And then the memories of what happened at the estate flashed through my mind. My kukri severing Vlad’s head from his body. Ilona’s snarl of rage before Abe staked her. Jonathan’s still body. Jonathan . . .

  “Jonathan,” I rasped abruptly, pulling back.

  “He is alive and quite well. He was here earlier,” Abe said reassuringly. I closed my eyes, trembling with relief. “I–I should apologize, Mina. We entered the estate too soon and nearly got you both killed. It was my fault; I panicked when I saw that there was a group of vampires with Vlad. Szabina wanted us to hold off.”

  “You forget that you saved my life. Ilona would have killed me,” I whispered, again reaching out to take his hand. “There is no need to apologize. I would have done the same if I feared your life was in danger.”

  “I have no doubt of that,” Abe said, the corners of this mouth twitching with a smile, before he got to his feet, reluctantly releasing my hand. “The doctor should examine you. We told the staff you were both in a carriage accident,” he added, lowering his voice. I nodded with implicit understanding; I needed to uphold the lie.

  Abe called for the doctor, a young man not much older than me with kind eyes. He allowed Abe to remain at my side as he gave me a cursory exam. He gently explained that after my carriage accident, I had been in a coma for a week. I had a broken wrist, sprained ribs, severe bruising around my throat, and a mild concussion. Severe blood loss caused my coma, and I had received a blood transfusion immediately upon admittance to the hospital.

  “It was your husband’s suggestion that your friends talk to you in an effort to help pull you out of your coma,” the doctor said, gesturing towards Abe with a rueful smile. “I do admit that I was skeptical at first, but it appears he was right. Quite helpful having a doctor for a husband. He would have treated you himself had we allowed it, Missus Harker,” he added with a wry smile.

  “I am not her husband,” Abe politely interjected. “Mina is my dearest friend. The man who was here earlier is her husband.”

  The doctor flushed and hastily apologized. He completed my exam, informing me that I appeared to be healing well, but he wanted me to remain in the hospital for another day for more rest before they released me.

  As soon as the doctor left us alone, I turned to Abe.

  “What . . . what happened?” I asked, my voice still raspy.

  “We are in a hospital in Essex. We brought you here and told the staff that both you and Jonathan had been in a carriage accident. Jonathan’s injuries were not as severe as yours. He had some bruising and blood loss, but he recovered a few days ago. He has been here at your side every day. After your transfusion, the doctor was not able to determine if—or how well—you would recover. I sent for Clara, and she has also been at your side all week. Jonathan, Clara and the others are staying at a nearby inn.”

  “Vlad and Ilona’s bodies,” I whispered. “Are they—”

  “We burned down the estate with their bodies inside; they all dissolved in the fire. The feral who transformed you is dead as well. You and Jonathan are no longer under the effects of the transformation. Szabina and Anara examined you both when the doctors were not nearby. Seward used his connections at Scotland Yard to have the fire declared an accident. No one outside of our group—except for Clara—knows what really happened.”

  I leaned back, closing my eyes. I thought I would feel an exuberant joy at the confirmation of Vlad and Ilona’s demise. Instead, I felt a growing unease as I recalled Vlad’s words. Even if you had succeeded, this does not end with me.

  “Vlad implied that there were others,” I said urgently. “Wh

at if—”

  “Desperate final words,” Abe interrupted, but he avoided my eyes. “I am going to fetch Clara and your husband. Try to rest, Mina. I–I am quite relieved that you are awake.”

  His behavior towards me was now oddly restrained and polite. There was no trace of the man who had made a tearful declaration of love only moments earlier.

  I absently picked at the meal the nurse brought in after he left me, and I was not aware of how much time had passed until I heard a delighted squeal.

  I looked up as Clara hurried into the room. She sat down on the bed and pulled me into a tight embrace, weeping. Gratitude swelled over me, and I was unable to hold back tears of my own. There had been moments during the journey when I had thought I’d never see her again.

  “Mina,” she whispered tearfully. “Thank God. My prayers’ve been answered.”

  She pulled back and proceeded to fuss over me, demanding that I eat all of my food. She informed me that she would make me spend a month in recovery, rather than the two weeks suggested by the doctor, and she would live with me permanently as I did so—married or not, she added. She did not inquire about any specifics of the journey, and I suspected that she didn’t want to know.

  When Jonathan entered moments later, she gave him a warm smile and embrace before leaving us alone.

  I took him in as he approached my bed. He still looked quite thin, his eyes shadowed with fatigue, but his color had returned and he looked like himself. He looked human.

  He blinked as he returned my visual assessment, as if not quite believing I was truly awake. It wasn’t until I gave him a tentative smile and stretched my hand out towards him that he moved forward, taking a seat at my side.

  “Darling,” he whispered, pulling me into his arms. “I was so frightened. I thought . . .” he trailed off, burying his face in my hair for a lengthy moment.

  When he pulled away, he told me that with Abe’s help, he had explained away his disappearance to his mother. He informed her that he had a rare illness that he could only receive treatment for outside of England, and he didn’t want to worry her. I had learned of his illness after the fact and went after him, and we wed when he feared for his life, but he was cured now. Mary had been so relieved to see him alive and well that she accepted his story without too much question, and merely went silent when he told her of our marriage.

  “I cannot tell you how happy I am to be holding you in my arms,” he breathed, as he pulled me into his arms once more. “What you did at the estate . . . I am in awe of you, Mina.”

  He continued to hold me until the nurse entered and told him that I needed to rest. He was reluctant to leave, and gave me a tender kiss on the forehead before finally leaving the room.

  In the day that followed, Gabriel, Seward, Anara, and Szabina all came to visit, praising me for my victory in killing Vlad. When I pressed them for news about any more unexplained murders or disappearances around Europe, any hint that a vampire threat still lingered, they simply urged me to focus on my recovery. But behind their warm words and smiles, there was a lingering tension, and I became certain that they were hiding something from me.

  After my release from the hospital, I was moved back to my home in Highgate instead of Jonathan’s. Jonathan insisted that I should recover at my own home in familiar surroundings rather than his, and along with Abe and Gabriel, he dutifully came to visit me daily, despite Clara’s insistence that I should not receive visitors until I was fully recovered. Despite her annoyance with the frequent visits, she did seem taken with Gabriel, whose existence she had accepted with surprising alacrity. As I predicted, she was relieved that I had a new family member, even if he was a vampire, and she fussed over him nearly as much as she fussed over me whenever he came to visit.

  As I rested at home, I grew increasingly edgy, hungry to know what had happened in the wake of Vlad’s death. Where had his surviving followers gone? Were any of them still in London? Clara waved off my request for newspapers, insisting that I focus on rest, and I wondered if she was hiding something as well.

  Two weeks after my return home, when Abe came by for one of his visits, I’d finally had enough. I bluntly asked if he was hiding anything from me.

  “Mina,” Abe warily replied, avoiding my gaze.

  “Abe,” I returned, leaning forward to make him look at me. “What is happening?”

  “You killed Vlad Draculesti, the Dracula. He had many passionate followers. Until we are certain you are no longer in danger, you will need to have guards. Jonathan has guards as well.”

  “Guards?” I echoed in disbelief.

  “Yes. Vampires,” Abe amended. “Gabriel trusts them, as do Anara and Szabina. You have fought alongside them. Do you remember Nikolaus and Kudret?” At my nod, he continued, “Gabriel followed you for years without you noticing. They will be discreet. You will hardly notice them. They have been positioned outside your home ever since your return.”

  I leaned back against my chair, frowning. The thought of having guards was mildly annoying but not altogether surprising, yet I could not shake the feeling that Abe was still withholding something.

  Before I could press him further, Clara entered the drawing room, trailed by Jonathan. Jonathan stiffened as he took us in, but he gave Abe a polite nod.

  “I was informing Mina about your guards,” Abe said, hastily getting to his feet. “I will take my leave.”

  He was gone before I could stop him, returning Jonathan’s polite nod.

  “She needs ta rest, Jonathan,” Clara said crossly. “No more visitors, Mina.”

  I couldn’t help but smile at her protectiveness, and she left the room with a scowl. I turned to Jonathan, giving him an apologetic look as he took a seat opposite me.

  “I apologize for her. Clara’s always been protective. Since I’ve returned home . . .”

  “I have seen it first hand,” Jonathan said, returning my amused smile. “She chastised all of us for visiting when you were in your coma, but I understand completely. She loves you. As do I.”

  His voice was strained, and I studied him closely. His smile was forced, and he held himself with rigid tension.

  “Has something happened?” I asked, worried.

  “What? No, not at all,” Jonathan replied, too quickly. “I–I would love some time alone with you, and it is a lovely day out. Are you well enough to walk?”

  “Yes,” I said eagerly, my unease dissipating at the thought of finally being able to leave the house. “But not very far,” I amended. “We may need to sneak out. Clara will have a fit at the mere thought of me taking a walk.”

  Jonathan’s eyes twinkled with amusement. He took my hand, exaggeratedly leading me from the drawing room as if he were sneaking me out, and I couldn’t hold back my laughter.

  Moments later, we were walking through the streets of Highgate, heading towards Waterlow Park. I felt cold stares on my back, and I instinctively stiffened. I glanced behind me, relaxing when I saw my two vampire guards, Nikolaus and Kudret. They gave me subtle nods.

  “It will take some time to get used to,” Jonathan observed, following my eyes. “I quite enjoy my guards . . . two large and intimidating gentlemen. I’m considering using them to frighten some of my law rivals.”

  I laughed, and he smiled in return, but it again seemed forced.

  “Jonathan,” I said, stopping mid stride. “I can tell that something is wrong. Please tell me what it is.”

  Jonathan did not immediately reply. Instead, he took my hand and led me into the park, where he sat down opposite me on a bench.

  “Mina,” he said softly, after a long pause. “You don’t belong here.”

  “What do you mean?” I whispered, my entire body going cold.

  “What I said on the Orient Express . . . I still believe it to be true. Your place is not here with me. I think we both know that. It’s why I was so jealous when I saw you with Van Helsing at the Langham. There was a connection between the two of you that you and I have never sha

red, despite our love for each other. If I keep you here in London as my wife, you would grow to resent your life, and I would always feel like I was keeping you in a life that you weren’t meant for.”

  “No,” I protested, feeling a hot rush of tears. “I meant what I told you on the train. My life is here with you, and—”

  “I do love you,” he interrupted, his voice wavering now as his eyes swept over my face. “Which is why I’m letting you go. I know you, Mina. More than you realize. You love deeply, and you are so very loyal. You would have stayed by my side for as long as I wished . . . even at the sake of your own true happiness.”

  “This is nonsense. I did not travel all the way to Transylvania to bring you home, only to lose you again,” I cried, blinking back my tears.

  “I owe you my life, but I will not hold you in my debt. Search your heart, Mina.”

  I looked away from him, forcing myself to think of my future in London—to truly think of it. Marrying Jonathan in an official society wedding. Participating in dinner parties, balls, the Season. Becoming a matriarch with children of my own. All the while wondering in the back of my mind about the path not taken; the life I could have lived. The sting of regret. The ever-present love for Abe lingering in my heart. And then the increasing discontent, the feeling of paralysis, of being trapped in a life I never wanted.

  When I looked back at him, my vision was blurred with tears. I tried to speak, but no words came, and Jonathan read in my eyes what I could not bring myself to say aloud.

  “There is no need to pretend anymore, Mina.”

  He pulled me into his arms, and my tears flowed freely as I pressed my face into his chest. Letting go was an odd feeling, like leaping off the edge of a cliff. Beneath my heartache, I felt stirrings of both freedom and loss, excitement and sorrow. Though I loved Jonathan, I would never fit into his world, though I had desperately tried. The beginning of our inevitable end had been the night he was abducted from the Langham, or perhaps even before that, when Abe approached me on the street to tell me that the monster from Transylvania had come to England.
  “I love you, Jonathan,” I whispered when I pulled back, taking in his handsome features, filing them away for my memories.

  “And I you. I release you from this marriage, Mina. Now that you are free, I want to tell you what the others have been hiding.”

  Astonishment rendered me still, and my heart did a catapult in my chest.

  “Van Helsing wanted me to keep it from you, but you have a right to know, and I know that you’ve already sensed it.”

  “What?” I whispered, my throat dry''',

      'Fortress Of Blood',
      '''The next morning, I awoke with a resolve that I had not felt since Jonathan’s abduction. It was barely past dawn when I opened my eyes, but I could already hear the familiar sounds of London waking up. The distant murmur of voices as merchants opened their shops and vendors set up their stalls; the knocker-uppers tapping on windows, rousing my neighbors from their slumber; the carriages clattering noisily through the streets.

  I slipped out of bed, remaining in my nightdress as I padded out into the hallway and entered the various rooms of my home. I began with the library, whose oak shelves were overflowing with books, many of which I still had not read. The spacious yet intimate drawing room where I had spent much of my time reading or preparing lesson plans. The dining room where I had once hosted an awkward dinner for Mary and Jonathan. The tiny back kitchen where I often ate dinner with Clara. The two barely used guest rooms that had unfortunately come to serve as storage spaces. And finally, Father’s study.

  Only weeks ago I had avoided the room, but now I welcomed the memories that swept over me as I entered, moving towards the desk where Father had spent much of his time. I recalled the scientific debates Father, Abe and I had engaged in here, the hours I had spent studying under Father’s tutelage or creating drawings for his publications, the quiet times when I would come in to read while he prepared his lessons or graded papers.

  Clara found me as I was seated at Father’s desk, looking down at an old photograph of my parents and me that he’d kept in one of the drawers.

  “Mina?” she asked, frowning as she entered the study. “Heard you movin’ about the house. Are you all right?”

  I placed the photograph back in the drawer, turning around to meet her eyes. I gave her a sad smile.

  “Yes,” I replied. “I was just saying goodbye.”

  Clara stilled, her face draining of color, but she did not look wholly surprised. She moved towards me, and I stood as she reached out to pull me into an embrace.

  “My bairn,” she sighed. “This is another day I knew would come.”

  Pulling away from her, I told her what I had learned from Jonathan the day before.

  I had sat motionless as he confirmed my suspicions about what the others were hiding from me.

  “There have been more abductions in other cities and villages since you killed Vlad. Van Helsing believes that there are more leaders Vlad allied himself with, and they have followers of their own. It appears we have eliminated the threat in London—for now. Vlad’s surviving followers have fled. Anara and some of our allies went to their temporary home in Mayfair, but they had all long gone. Van Helsing and the others are presently at Gabriel’s home in Thatcham trying to determine who and where the other leaders are. The threat will not be truly over until they’re all dead.”

  I was silent, reeling from his words. My dark fears had turned out to be true. Vlad was only a part of the vampire threat against the human world. I recalled Lucy’s words from weeks ago. One of the Old Families. There was the Draculesti family that was now no more. But who else was there?

  “They expect us to remain in London while they continue the fight. I do belong here . . . but not you, Mina.”

  He reached out to tilt my stricken face towards his, placing a gentle kiss on my forehead, and I realized that it was a goodbye kiss. My eyes again filled with tears as I was struck by my shock at his words and my heartache.

  “Thank you for telling me,” I whispered. He nodded, placing a folded piece of paper into my shaking hands.

  “Directions to Gabriel’s home. I don’t know how much longer they will be there—you should make haste.”

  We walked back to my home in silence. Once we arrived at my front door, he raised my left hand to his lips, lovingly kissing my knuckles, and I noticed that I still wore my engagement ring, which now seemed obscenely out of place. When he released my hand, I started to slide it off, but he shook his head.

  “Promise me that we’ll still be in each other’s lives. Write to me. Call on me. Please,” I whispered.

  “Of course,” Jonathan replied, reaching out to touch the side of my face with tenderness. “And I shall never forget that I have a life because of you.”

  I closed my eyes and leaned in to his touch, and we stood quietly for a moment before he withdrew. And then he was gone, descending the stairs and heading down the street with his hands shoved into his pockets, his head lowered, trailed by two large men who I recognized from our group––his vampire guards. I remained on my doorstep, my heart filled with a maelstrom of conflicting emotions—love, sadness, resolve, excitement. I watched him until he disappeared into a cab at the end of the street.

  Now, Clara listened intently as I finished recounting what had occurred. She gave me a sympathetic smile, her eyes dropping to my now ringless hand.

  “I noticed when you came in yesterday . . . wanted you ta tell me when you were ready. He was not t’man for you, my bairn.”

  “I thought you liked Jonathan,” I said, surprised. “You never raised any objection to our courtship.”

  “I do. He’s a good man. I could tell he loved you ‘n you seemed happy. I t’ought by marryin’ him you’d stay away from Transylvania ‘n out of danger,” she said, her eyes twinkling at the irony. “Anyone wit’ eyes can see who you should be wit’,” she added mischievously.

  “Clara—”

  “T’at’s all I’m going ta say,” Clara said, raising up her hands. “Let’s get you packed.”

  “You’re not going to try to stop me?” I asked in disbelief. I had braced myself for her protest to my departure.

  “You wouldn’t listen if I did . . . ‘n you have your brother. I like him, even if he is . . . you know,” she added hastily.

  “I know,” I said, giving her an amused smile.

  I washed and dressed in a comfortable lavender walking suit, and she helped me pack my trunk before we ate breakfast together. To my surprise, she asked me for details about my journey to Transylvania. I began with Lucy directing us to Transylvania under hypnosis, the attack on the Demeter, Arthur’s death, the villagers in Holland who helped us, Greta’s experiments in Amsterdam, the train derailment, the discovery of Gabriel, meeting Radu and Anara, and the revelations from Szabina about my mother. When I was finished, it took me a moment to realize that my eyes glistened with tears, and Clara reached out to cover my hand with hers.

  “My brave bairn,” she murmured, her eyes also shimmering with tears.

  We sat in silence for a long moment before I told her I needed to make two stops before I left, and she urged me to go, insisting that she would finish the last of my packing.

  My first stop was the school. I surprised the teacher who had taken my place, a woman my age with frizzy blonde hair, gentle brown eyes and an amiable nature. She graciously paused her lesson to allow me to bid my students farewell.

  Their faces fell at the news of my departure, but one student boldly asked for a final adventure story. I hesitated before glancing at the teacher, who gave me an encouraging nod.

  The students listened with wide-eyed attention as I told them an amended version of the tale I told Clara—replacing vampires with wolves, omitting the more violent moments, and changing the names of all involved. When I finished, the silence was deafening.

  “Did that really ‘appen, Missus?” asked young Isaac Morris, his eyes round.

  “Of course it did,” I said, giving him a c

onspiratorial wink. I turned to look at the teacher, who was looking at me with mild disconcertion.

  “Take care of them,” I said. She blinked and nodded, giving me an assuring smile.

  As I left the classroom and headed down the corridor towards the exit, I heard a familiar voice behind me.

  “Miss Murray.”

  I stilled, turning to find Horace waddling towards me with his trademark scowl.

  “I overheard you telling the children another one of—”

  “There is no need to scold me, Mister Welling. I’m leaving my post.”

  I initially had no intention of telling him of my resignation in person, and I’d written a letter that was to be sent to him after I departed London. I felt no desire to see the look of pleasure on his face when I resigned, and I was irritated that I would now to be forced to do so.

  But Horace stiffened, actually looking disappointed by my news. He must have had the hope of sacking me himself.

  “Good,” he said. “I would have gladly released you from your post myself. You still violated our agreement by plying the children with another of those nonsensical stories. Therefore, I will have to begin discussions about funding for the class.”

  “What?” I breathed, horrified.

  “You heard me,” he said, looking quite pleased by my reaction. “I—”

  But he faltered, his eyes straying to something behind me, and I turned.

  Nikolaus and Kudret had entered the corridor behind me. Though they were dressed like London gentlemen, there was no denying their otherworldly nature, and they looked like dark avenging angels as they loomed at the end of the corridor. Abe was right; I had almost forgotten that they were shadowing me.

  I turned back to face Horace, whose focus remained on the two vampires, looking absolutely terrified.

  “Mina,” Kudret said from behind me. “Are you all right?”

  “What were you saying, Horace?” I asked coolly, struggling to suppress a smile of relief.

  “I . . . ah—” he faltered, his eyes still on the vampires behind me. “I wish you the best. Thank . . . thank you for your work here.”

  “And I thank you,” I returned. “I hope not to hear of anything happening to this class or the students. Otherwise, my friends will be quite upset.”

  “Of . . . of course not,” Horace said, taking a faltering step backwards as Nikolaus and Kudret stepped forward to flank me, never taking their eyes from his pale face.

  I thanked them once we left the school, smiling as I recalled the look on Horace’s face.

  We took the Underground back to Highgate, and I made my way to Highgate Cemetery. Nikolaus and Kudret lingered behind as I walked ahead of them, taking the familiar path to my parents’ graves.

  I kneeled down in front of their headstones. It was odd visiting here, now that I knew their many secrets. But I no longer felt any bitterness towards them, only a calm acceptance. I understood why they wouldn’t want me to know of the hidden world of vampires; it was a world filled with evil and constant danger. But now that I was well aware of it, there would be no going back, and I had been foolish to think otherwise.

  I have avenged your deaths, I said silently, reaching out to touch their engraved names. I understand that you wanted to protect me, but I must prevent more deaths.

  When I returned home, my trunk was completely packed. Clara’s eyes brimmed with a fresh wave of tears as we embraced farewell.

  “What did you say to Abe when we left the first time?” I asked when I pulled away from her, struck by the memory from weeks ago.

  “I told him I know how much he loves you, and ta keep you safe,” Clara replied, with a knowing smile.

  During the brief train journey to Thatcham, my thoughts drifted to Abe. Abe, who had never been far from my thoughts, even during the years of our separation. Abe, whose voice had brought me back from the brink of death. Abe, whom I loved—whom I had always loved.

  When I arrived at Gabriel’s home, a sprawling brick farmhouse on the outskirts of Thatcham, Nikolaus and Kudret trailed me inside the unlocked front door. As soon as we entered, I heard the rise of familiar voices from the drawing room at the end of the entrance hall.

  “He only wants to go to Amsterdam because his bloody lab is there,” Seward was protesting. “We’re surrounded by vampires. We don’t need any more experiments, Abe. What we need is to find these—”

  “That is not why I want to go back,” Abe interjected. “Greta has done extensive research in the library, and she has more—”

  “She can wire us any information she has,” Seward said. “Going back to Amsterdam isn’t needed when—”

  He fell silent, blinking at me in astonishment as I entered the large drawing room that was filled with familiar faces. Abe, Seward, Gabriel, Anara, and Szabina. They were all seated in chairs or standing around the unlit fireplace.

  At the sight of them, I was filled with warmth. I hadn’t realized how much I missed this group of humans and vampires.

  The silence stretched as they all took me in, agape. Szabina and Seward slowly broke into broad smiles. Anara remained stoic, though I glimpsed a flicker of pleasure in her eyes. Gabriel frowned with concern, while Abe looked bewildered.

  “I suggest we go to Matford,” I said calmly. “My father’s family has a country home there that was left to him. Do you remember it, Abe? He only used it when he needed time away from London to work on his publications.”

  My words seemed to tear Abe from his shock, and he lurched to his feet, his eyes straying accusingly towards my guards.

  “Yes, I remember, but we are not using it because you are not coming with us. What are you doing here? Where is your husband?”

  “He is in London, and I am coming with you,” I said. “We can’t stay here. It’s not safe. Matyas knows of Gabriel, and I have no doubt that he can find out where he lives. The home in Matford can accommodate us before we move on to our next destination. Father kept much of his research there. We know he was researching vampires. There may be something of use to us there.”

  “No,” Abe said. “It is far too dangerous for you to come with us, I have explained why. Vlad’s remaining followers will be hunting for you. Surely, your husband does not want you to put—”

  “Jonathan and I have ended our marriage,” I evenly replied. “He’s the one who told me of your plans.”

  Another silence fell over the group, and they all exchanged uncomfortable looks at my news. A flicker of some emotion I could not identify passed over Abe’s face before it was gone again, and he looked away.

  “You barely survived your encounter with Vlad and Ilona,” Gabriel spoke up, stepping forward. “It’s not safe for you to—”

  “It’s not safe for anyone until we find and kill Vlad’s allies,” I interrupted.

  “Haven’t either of you learned?” Seward asked, rising to his feet. “It’s best not to argue with Mina when she’s made up her mind.”

  “Thank you, Seward,” I said.

  “Mina Harker, the infamous killer of the Dracula,” Seward continued, giving me a wry smile. “Of course, she can join us.”

  “Mina Murray,” Abe corrected him, looking cross. “She just informed us she is no longer married.”

  “Murray, Harker—doesn’t matter. My sentiment still stands. Wouldn’t be a proper journey without you, Mina,” Seward said, looking at me with unwavering sincerity.

  “I wanted to tell you all along,” Szabina said, meeting my eyes. “Mina is a part of this,” she said, addressing the others. “She has always been a part of this.”

  “I agree,” Anara added, giving me an affirming nod.

  Abe and Gabriel were the only ones who still looked turbulent, but I turned my focus to Abe.

  “May I speak with you privately?” I asked.

  We left the room as everyone’s voices again rose in debate, as if I had not interrupted at all. We entered the kitchen directly across the hall, and once we were alone, I closed the gap be

tween us, standing on tiptoe to press my lips against his.

  For a moment, he stiffened with surprise, then fervently returned my kiss, his arms encircling my body to hold me close. For the first time since he approached me on the street in the East End, I didn’t suppress the rush of love I felt for him, and allowed it to flow through every part of me, like a caged bird finally set free.

  When we broke apart, we were breathless, and I remained in the circle of his arms.

  “I’ve been hiding for so long,” I whispered. “I heard every word you said when I was coming out of my coma. I love you, Abraham Van Helsing. I’ve never stopped. Jonathan knew. I think he’s always known, even when I didn’t allow myself to.”

  “I thought I had lost you,” Abe tremulously replied. “I–I was prepared to live without you. To love you from afar.”

  “You don’t have to. Not anymore. We’ve lost so much time,” I said, with a sharp sting of regret. “I felt so guilty after Father died that I pushed you away.”

  “It is in the past. There is no need to dwell on regret,” he said. He straightened, intently searching my eyes. “Are you prepared to leave your life in London behind? Your students? Clara?” He hesitated, before adding, “Jonathan?”

  “Yes,” I replied. “My life has never truly been in London . . . I was just hiding there. You forced me out of hiding.”

  “Me—and vampires,” Abe added ruefully, his lips twitching with a smile.

  “And vampires,” I amended, with a small grin.

  His arms tightened around me, and I rested my head against his chest, grateful to share a brief moment of happiness before we returned to the perilous undertaking of saving the human world.

  The next morning, as the sun began its leisurely ascent above the horizon, we all mounted the horses in the back stables. The night before, we had finally agreed that my father’s home in Matford would indeed be our first destination. Matford was not far from Thatcham, and as there was no direct train connection, we had decided to travel there on horseback.
  I was the first to ride my horse out of the stables. The air was much clearer here than in London, and I breathed it in. It was damp with early morning dew, and a slight chill clung to it. My eyes swept over the distant green countryside, periodically dotted by lone farmhouses, illuminated by the slowly rising sun.

  Abe and the others trotted out of the stables on their horses, bringing them to a stop alongside mine. I turned to regard our makeshift family of humans and vampires. My gaze lingered on Abe, who gave me an encouraging nod and a loving smile. It was time to leave.

  I turned back to face the countryside. Gripping the reins of my horse, I leaned forward to ride away from the farmhouse, with Abe at my side and the others trailing behind us, towards whatever lay ahead.''',

      'The Gravity of Us',
      '''At home, I’m invisible. At school, I’m bizarre. But to the rest of the world, I’m a journalist.

  I get this specific feeling—a tug in my gut, a hitch in my breath—every time I craft a news story, open the FlashFame app, and broadcast live to my 435,000 followers.

  When I step off the Q train at the Times Square stop and shoulder my way to the exit, I take a moment to collect my thoughts. I pull in a hearty breath and smile. Holding the phone in front of my face, I go over the plan in my head for my weekly New York City update. What to cover, where to walk.

  “Hiya!” I shout into the phone and smirk as the commuters behind me dash out of view. “I’m Cal, and welcome to my weekend update. New York’s been slow on the news front—murders and Amber Alerts, all normal stuff—but in national news, one thing is a standout: the search for the twentieth and final astronaut to be added to the Orpheus project.”

  In the front-facing camera, I see the city scroll by in a mass of billboards, shops, cabs, and bikes. I try not to show the strain in my smile, and remind myself that even the most seasoned reporters have to report on what their viewers want to hear most. And according to my comments, there’s no contest: people want to know the latest. It’s not like I’m surprised—it’s all anyone can talk about right now. Six humans will be setting foot on Mars, and it’s ignited an interest the space program hasn’t seen in decades.

  “The astronaut in question will be chosen in the coming weeks, after which they will relocate to Houston to vie for a spot on the Orpheus V spacecraft, the first crewed mission to Mars.”

  If this performance doesn’t win me an Emmy, I will throw a fit. You ever tell someone you’re overjoyed by something, when secretly you’d rather vomit in a bucket than talk about it anymore? That’s me with the Mars missions. I hate the hype.

  However, people are so wrapped up in the drama around this Mars mission, you’d think it was the latest Real Housewives installment. Therein lies my dilemma: Do I want to report on things people care about? Yes. Do I want more followers and viewers? Also yes.

  “A representative of StarWatch spoke about the search today,” I continue, “but the cable gossip network didn’t offer any new information about the candidates.”

  After my brief, obligatory NASA report, I bring the stream back to New York City by offering recommendations for the biggest events of the weekend: parties, farmers’ markets, and everything in between. All while watching the live viewer count climb.

  I’ve done local stories, national stories, worldwide stories before. I covered a full midterm election year, attending rallies for Senate and House candidates in the tristate area, even the severely inept ones who thought microwaves gave you cancer.

  I used to feel helpless every time I opened up my news aggregating app, but reporting gave me a platform for my voice, and that resonated with people.

  While cable news angled stories to fit their followers and pushed sensational bullshit—Is Trump homophobic? We interviewed this homophobic Trump voter to get his thoughts!—my reports covered the real news. Raw and unbiased.

  Like when the Republican candidate for New York senator fell off the grid and refused to debate or see the press until election night … but had no problem attacking his opponents on Twitter. One day, it slipped that he’d been seen in the city, so I slipped out of school and waited outside the restaurant where he was.

  I started incognito with my phone in my chest pocket and asked him some light questions. He obliged, until I brought up his pending embezzlement investigation, charges of sexual harassment, and the recent staffing shakeup that could have been related to either.

  In the end, I chased his limo up Fifth Avenue, where he cursed me—and the fifty thousand viewers—out, live.

  Needless to say, he did not win the election.

  Nowadays, I carefully plan my videos for the week. National news updates one day, a focus on teen issues another, with a few personal stories sprinkled in. Then, there are my NYC updates. Even if they don’t get the most views, these streams are my favorites. It’s me, the city, and quadrillions of New Yorkers and tourists in the background.

  The front-facing camera starts to show just how much the humidity is taking a toll on my once perfectly coiffed hair, and if I don’t sign off soon, I’ll look like a frazzled maniac.

  “Wow, I guess there was a lot to talk about, because”—I flip away from the front-facing camera and give my viewers a panoramic shot of my surroundings, and the tall buildings on all sides blend into a mix of brick and concrete—“we’re already at Thirty-Eighth and Broadway.”

  These updates always start at the northern tip of Times Square, and I usually just walk down Broadway until I run out of things to say, or until my voice starts to crack. And even in the latter case, I’ve been known to subject my viewers to the true New York experience: buying a seltzer on the street—after haggling the price down to a reasonable amount, of course.

  “And that’s all I’ve got. Keep an eye on my FlashFame story to see why I’ll be scouring the streets of the Lower East Side.” I flash a smirk as I end the transmission, and release a deep sigh as I shed my journalistic brand.

  I catch the F train at 34th toward Brooklyn, which is about the only way to get to the Lower East Side from where I’m at. The flair of the city dims as tourists block the subway doors, as the train stops between stations for three minutes at a time, as the air-conditioning breathes lukewarm air down my neck.

  The notifications roll in from my video, which was watched live by around eighty thousand people. But somehow, FlashFame knows which comments to highlight, specifically the one that will slash deepest into my heart.

  JRod64 (Jeremy Rodriguez): Love this!

  How long does it take to get over someone you barely even dated? The irony of him “loving” my posts when he couldn’t even commit to “liking” me is at the forefront of my mind, and a rage burns inside me.

  The anger ebbs as I walk the streets of the Lower East Side, where the tall buildings of midtown have disappeared, replaced with short brick apartments with fire escapes, towering over everything from abandoned bodegas to artisan vegan bakeries. I double-check the address and take the stairs down into a dark, windowless shop.

  “Jesus, Calvin, there you are,” Deb says. She always uses my full name. She full-names everyone but herself, really—but that’s because she says Deborah is a grandma name. “I’ve been in this store since you signed off, and the owners of this cassette shop really like to talk about cassettes, and I didn't have the heart to tell them I was only here to be your cassette wingwoman. I think they know I’m a fraud.”

  “I would pay to see you pretending to be a cassette fangirl.” The thought makes me laugh.

  “It’s not hard. I just repeated the bullshit you say—‘the sound is much smoother’ or whatever. It was going fine until he asked me the model and year of my boom box.”

  I browse the collection while Deb impatiently waits behind me. I promised her a vegan doughnut—or twelve—from the bakery across the street in exchange for making the trip to browse cassettes with me. Unfortunately, nothing here catches my eye.

  I raid a few tapes from the dollar bin based on their covers alone—guys with beautiful, flowing eighties hair, movie soundtracks with old VHS-style covers—and unironically pay for my retro tapes using my iPhone.

  “Finally,” Deb says as she busts out of the record store. “That place was weird. You’re weird.”

  “I’m well aware of both, thanks.”

  We meander through the Lower East Side, which isn’t all that different from our neighborhood in Brooklyn. Okay, it’s a little bit dirtier, and there are fewer toddlers getting in my way, but otherwise, I see the similarities.

  “I love this area,” Deb says.

  “Yeah, it’s okay for things like that random pop-up cassette shop,” I say with a shrug. “I hear they’re putting in a Trader Joe’s here.”

  “Jesus,” she swears. “Of course they are.”

  We duck into a tiny bakery with no more than five stools of seating. The two bakers are cramped behind the counter, and I start to get claustrophobic on their behalf. But as I look around, I see glimpses of the neighborhood in notices plastered on the walls. Yoga classes, babysitting offers, piano lessons, writers’ groups. Panning out, I see protest signs, queer pride flags of all varieties, old campaign stickers from the past couple of elections.

  New York has a way of making you feel at home, no matter where you’re at. You just have to step off the street, and some neighborhood will claim you as one of their own.

  “Exactly how do you make a vegan lemon curd?” Deb asks, fascinated, and I realize I’m missing her in her element. Before the baker can even answer, she rambles on. “This place is amazing. I’m going to get a dozen, but I think I want literally one of each flavor. Is that too much?” she asks no one in particular.

  I’m a vegetarian, but she’s a full-on vegan, and she’s in heaven. Vegans get a bad rap, but Deb’s always been down-to-earth about it. She embraces it, but not to the extent where she’s treating it like a cult.

  This also means we have to go to every new vegan restaurant, bakery, pop-up, and festival the moment it opens, and I am not complaining about that.

  “You’re sharing these with me, right?” I ask.

  “Oh dear sweet Jesus in heaven,” she says after biting into a doughnut. “Not if they’re all as good as this lemon curd.”

  We take our time walking toward Brooklyn, with no real destination in mind. It’s too far to walk all the way, but it’s a surprisingly nice day, and I’m not in a rush. I know Deb’s not.

  “You shouldn’t have paid for these,” Deb says. “I have a job, dude. You don’t need to jump in and save me anymore.”

  I blush. “I know, it wasn’t that. But I left you alone in that cassette pop-up, so defenseless you had to pretend you were one of us to fit in. The horrors you must have overcome. This is the least I can do.”

  What I don’t say is, I know she’s saving every penny from her job. Deb works harder than anyone I know. If I could fix her home life, I would. But until we can flee our respective coops, all I can do is pay for her sugar high.

  “One World Trade. We’re approaching tourist central,” I say. “I’ll take a few pics for my Flash story, then we’ve got to get a train.”

  The sun’s nowhere to be seen, but a series of low clouds pass by, getting split in two by the shining tower. It’s a perfect New York afternoon, but I feel the tug in my chest that reminds me what’s waiting for me at home. As we hop on a train and make half smiles at each other, I can tell we’re thinking the same thing. There’s a pretty high chance that one or both of our nights are about to be ruined by our parents.

  We make it back to Brooklyn in record time. Anxiety grips my chest as I take the stairs up our stoop, and I know Deb usually feels the same. To be quite honest, I would have been fine spending a few more minutes delaying the inevitable awkward conversations and heated fights that wait for me at home. Not like the arguments are ever directed at me, but they’re still all around me. Lingering.

  Wearing our family down.

  I part ways with Deb at the third floor of our apartment building, and a tightness balls up in my shoulders—clenching, constricting—when I launch up the stairs to my apartment, taking them two at a time. Before I even reach my door with the shiny 11 on it, I hear the shouts.

  It wasn’t always like this.

  I put the key in the lock, and with a heavy sigh, I turn it.

  A frown falls over my face almost instantly. I slam the door to make my presence known, but it doesn’t fix things, it doesn’t stop them. I want my being home to mean something. I want … I don’t know what I want—to not feel helpless when they’re like this. I try to escape into my phone, but my notifications are once again flooded with questions about … the astronauts.

  I sigh as I scroll through.

  kindil0o (Chelsea Kim): Hi, big fan. Um, is it just me or have you stopped profiling the astronauts? I used to love your streams, and I still do, but I’d like to see more of your old stuff. Are we getting to Mars or not? You only spent like 30 secs on the new astronaut search??

  I mute the notification. Of course my followers would notice how short my NASA segments are, how my eyes dart away from the camera when I mention the search for the newest astronauts.

  Everyone wants to know why, and I’m staring at the reason: my dad just flew back from Houston from his final round of interviews with NASA.

  If he has it his way, I’ll never escape this mission.''',

      '''“Stop waiting by the phone,” my mom shouts. “They said they’d call you today if you were chosen. It’s five thirty. You’ve used all your vacation days and it’s barely June; you’re flying back and forth from Houston every few weeks—it’s taken over your life. It’s taken over our lives.”

  She points to me, and just like that, I’m a part of their game. A pawn left out conspicuously to lure a bishop and set up a checkmate. She makes eye contact with me, and I briefly see the exhaustion on her face. The panic, the stress. But my gaze darts away. I won’t give her that power. I won’t be a part of this.

  “I’m sorry, but it’s time to drop this fantasy,” Mom says, turning her attention back to Dad. “Just … think about it practically. We can’t relocate. I have a life, a job.”

  “Does this really have to happen every other day?” I say as I rush down the hallway toward my room.

  “It’s only four thirty in Houston.” Dad clears his throat, almost nervously. “And you work remotely. You could code anywhere. I know you don’t want to hear it, but there’s still a chance. A real chance this could happen.”

  “What about Calvin?” she snaps back. “We’d pull him from his school just before his senior year? Did you ever tell him about what this would mean for his videos?”

  “Wait. What about my videos?” I spin back toward them, but as I do, the pieces fall into place. If he got the job, we wouldn’t only be moving to Houston, we’d basically be stepping onto a TV set.

  Every moment of our lives would be monitored, recorded by StarWatch for their annoying Shooting Stars show.

  They’re both avoiding eye contact.

  “Well, we don’t know anything for sure,” Dad starts, “but there was a clause in the paperwork.”

  “A clear clause,” Mom says as she slowly massages her temples, “that said no other public video transmissions can be made including people involve

d with the mission. And as family, they would consider us a part of the mission.”

  And I’m gone.

  “Cal, wait!”

  I slam my bedroom door and lean against it.

  Within seconds, my parents are back at it, and there’s a part of me that wants to turn around and fix this. To make things right again. They still fought before the astronaut thing, but rarely, and not like this. My fists clench as I argue with myself, wondering whether it’s worth sticking my neck out, trying to help them, trying to stop them.

  But that’s never worked.

  “You’re making me dread coming home, Becca. Every time I come back with good news, you fly off the handle!”

  “I’ve lived here my whole life.” Mom’s hurt voice creeps through my door. It’s like they’re having two separate conversations. Neither’s listening to the other. “This was our first home. I was born here, my … family was born here.”

  I hear what she doesn’t say—my aunt was born here too. She lived down the street from us for years. This street, this neighborhood is all tied up in memories of her. No wonder Mom doesn’t want to leave.

  “You didn’t have the decency to run it by me before you—”

  That’s all I let myself hear.

  This is another reason why my dad can’t be an astronaut: we’re clearly not fit to be an astronaut family.

  NASA picked their first astronauts for the Orpheus missions three years ago, in small groups—three or four added each time. Orpheus I through IV tested individual components of the spacecraft, each test more successful than the last.

  The families, though, became stars. What they have is flawless; their personal and professional stories follow a story arc that even I couldn’t write. It’s hard to look at them and not think they have everything my family doesn’t.

  The astronauts have heated arguments that line the pages of People magazine, and sure, sometimes one of the spouses will have a little too much to drink during brunch. But they still smile for the cameras. They know how to make their imperfections seem … perfect.

  In the end, they stay happy and supportive—two qualities my parents haven’t shown in a while.
  I plug my headphones into my retro tape deck and put them on. I add my new finds and sort through the rest of my eclectic collection of cassettes: Nirvana, Dolly Parton, Cheap Trick, bands and artists I only know thanks to my thrift store finds. I settle on Cheap Trick and jam it in, and let the guitar overtake the voices.

  Dad wants to be one of them. The astronauts, that is. Way more than he wants to be who he is now—an air force pilot turned commercial air pilot who wants to ditch the 747 for a spaceship. NASA announced they’d be hiring the final five astronauts for the Orpheus project. He applied months ago, when most of the spots had already been taken up.

  I didn’t have the heart to talk to him about his chances. I covered them all in my reports: one of the new recruits was an astrophysicist with a social media following nearing Kardashian levels, another a geologist/marine biologist who’d won two Oscars for her documentaries and even a Grammy for a spirited reading of her audiobook—which was a bestseller, of course. And those weren’t the most impressive ones.

  Dad’s a good pilot, I’m sure, but he’s not like them.

  He’s angry. Impatient. Surly. Okay, I’m not painting him in the best light. I mean, he is an okay dad in other ways—he’s super smart and gives killer advice on my calc homework. But it’s like everything my mom says hurts him like a physical attack. He snaps back, which triggers my mom’s anxiety. Their fighting isn’t camera ready. It’s messy, it’s real, in a way that’s too raw to be captured by a camera.

  If they can’t put on a show for me—at least pretend that everything’s okay, like Deb’s parents do—how can they put on a show for the world?

  I get through a few tracks while I sit on the floor and close my eyes. There’s nothing else but the music. And a few cars beeping outside. Okay, more than a few. This is Brooklyn, after all.

  After a while, a calmness pours over me, drowning out the fear. I feel … at peace. Alone and no longer worried about my future plans. Not worried about the BuzzFeed internship I start next week. Not worried about the hundreds of messages in my inbox—replies to the weekly Cal Letter (I couldn’t think of a clever name, don’t judge)—where I link to my videos along with important news stories, geared toward those who give a shit about the world.

  I think about these things, but I’m able to push them out of my mind for a few minutes, then a few more, until I have to get up and switch cassettes. The tension in my chest eases. It’s meditation. For me, it’s the most effective self-care system in the world.

  That is, until I hear a knock.

  Through noise-canceling headphones and blasted music, I hear it. Which means it’s less of a knock and more of a pound, but regardless, I take off my headphones and shout, “Yeah?”

  My mom peers into the room—she’s always afraid she’ll catch me doing “something,” and we all know what that “something” is, but I’m also not an idiot and can figure out how to do said “something” twice a day having never been caught thank you very much.

  But then I notice her expression. She’s tearing up, which is not good.

  See, she doesn’t cry. They fight, they yell, they make things seriously unpleasant for everyone in a two-apartment radius, but they don’t cry. They shout, then Mom retreats from the world and Dad goes for a walk. It’s how they process. Getting at each other’s throats, but not offending the other bad enough to let them carry their hurt to the next hour.

  And … here she is, crying.

  “I, um.” Mom comes into the doorway now. I scan her for bruises, for covered arms, for anything—though I know Dad would never hurt her like that, I never see her upset like this, so my mind reaches for options.

  Until she speaks.

  “Come into the family room. Your father has news.”

  News.

  My mind freezes. Did the phone ring sometime in the past hour? Did NASA interrupt their fight to tell Dad he was chosen for …?

  But that doesn’t make sense. We’re not like them. We’re not ever going to be like them. NASA should be able to figure that out, right?

  Before I get too far ahead of myself, I stop the tape and make my way to the door, seeing the empty space where my mother just stood. She turns the corner quickly, leaving just a fluttering patch of fabric in her wake. She’s running away from this conversation, and away from the face I know I made when she said “news.”

  Like it could mean anything else.

  I make it halfway down the hall when, pop, a champagne bottle confirms the fears flowing through my body. My gut turns to mush. My heart rate doubles. I feel it all over my body like an electric shock, but instead of causing sudden jerks of movement, everything is slow. My nerves dance, but my limbs won’t cooperate. All is ash and tasteless, and smells are weak, and I can’t even come up with metaphors that make sense because …

  “A glass for each of us—even for you, Cal. It’s a special occasion.” Dad hands them out, his happy face immune to the terrified, broken expressions on ours. “And a toast, well, to me. NASA’s newest astronaut.”

  It takes a few seconds for the words to sink in, and it’s like my brain is the last one to this party. My fists clench. Breaths won’t come. I feel the pressure building everywhere, in my back, my sinuses, my stomach. My legs ache as I repeat the word in my head: Astronaut. Astronaut.

  Astronaut.

  You know how sometimes you say a word so often it loses its meaning? That doesn’t happen. The definition sticks in my brain—and it’s even in the etymology. Astro-naut. Space explorer. What every three-year-old kid has not so secretly wanted to be since the sixties.

  I slam my champagne glass down with a clink and push past my mother. The hallway blurs by as I barrel into our bathroom. I don’t know what this means for my dad, my mom, or me. But I do know one thing:

  I’m going to be sick.

  Shooting Stars

  Season 1; Episode 6

  EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: On this episode of Shooting Stars, astronaut Grace Tucker sits down with host Josh Farrow and gets straight to the question we get most from our loyal StarWatch fans. (First aired 6/15/2019)

  “Good evening, StarWatchers, I’m Josh Farrow. Tonight we welcome Grace Tucker: a fierce pilot, a brilliant engineer, and above all else, a determined astronaut. Who knows what role she’ll play in the Orpheus project? Will she assist from the ground, or could she possibly leave the first human footprint on the surface of Mars? It’s only her third month on the project, after all, but she’s made quite a name for herself. We have Grace in the studio tonight to discuss all this and more … Grace, thank you for joining us tonight. There are nine of you now, and NASA recently announced they will add up to eleven more to the Orpheus project over the next year.”

  “Thanks for having me, Josh. You and I know NASA wants the best astronauts. There was a time when NASA’s astronauts were only the toughest, roughest white men. Think back to the Mercury Seven and the New Nine—men like Deke Slayton, Alan Shepard, Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad. They were all smart as hell, sure, but in time NASA realized the benefit of diversity. Diversity in skill set; in place of life; in race, gender, identity, and orientation.”

  “Yes, of course. But we—Shooting Stars viewers—also know NASA has not always been at the forefront of these issues. Like how Mae Carol Jemison, the first black woman in space, went up on Endeavour in the early nineties. That was, what, thirty-some years after the space program was founded?”

  “Which, if I may interrupt, is why diversity in the space program has always been one of my top priorities, and I’ve made that clear from my first days at NASA. So I fully stand behind NASA’s decision here, and I look forward to meeting and flying with the new recruits.”

  “Let me put this another way: Do you think your chances of leading this flight are dropping, given how many new recruits NASA’s bringing on board?”

  “I’m not worried, Josh. Nothing’s a given in this environment—you must know that. I could be taken off the mission for getting the flu a day before laun

ch. The government could pull funding; your fans could lose their interest. I just do my best every day. It’s all any of us can do.”''',

      'The Gravity of Us',
      '''Maybe it’s the panic, but Grace’s first StarWatch interview plays in my mind. Over and over and over. It’s the only thing I can think of. Grace’s upright posture, her camera-ready attitude. Her subtle concern.

  I flush the toilet and stand to stare at my reflection. My face glistens with sweat, and my panted breaths fog the mirror. I wipe it away and start to brush my teeth, holding my own gaze like it’s the only thing keeping me here, keeping me grounded.

  My mind fills with more news stories. Local, national, gossip, blogs. The barely covered press release announcing the relocation of all astronaut families to Houston, the rumors of a shuttered mission—why spend money on space exploration when we could better fund schools or infrastructure?

  And I remember the moment it all changed.

  StarWatch Network announced its partnership with NASA, complete with a teaser episode of Shooting Stars featuring a pilot in a simulation cockpit. Sweat dripped down astronaut Mark Bannon’s brow as the narrator explained the test.

  During the simulation, as the craft entered Mars’s atmosphere, the screen goes blank. As the surface of Mars comes into view, fast, Mark resets the gauges. When this fails, he reaches for a pen and paper beneath his seat. The scene cuts to Mark entering coordinates and new trajectories into the still-glowing command module. As the craft nears the ground, all panels come back to life, giving Mark just enough time to make final adjustments before … thud.

  “Orpheus V has landed,” he says between breaths.

  Then the screen cuts to a message to tune in weekly to watch StarWatch’s new show: Shooting Stars.

  The uptick in attention the families got from adoring fans was instant. To some, they became American heroes; to some, they became the newest reality show. They’re interesting. They’re perfect. They’re …

  Not like us.

  “Calvin, honey?” My mom’s voice is hoarse.

  My parents file in after I gain the strength to unlock the door. Mom’s got the look of a concerned mother down perfectly, all creased brows and soft eyes. But my dad’s got a different expression. His mouth slants, and he seems detached from it all. I can’t tell if he’s annoyed, or just not tolerating my reaction. Yeah, it was a little much, but I don’t exactly have control over when my falafel cart lunch decides to make a fast escape.

  “Are you done?” he asks, and all my muscles tighten at once.

  “I’m fine,” I say. “I—uh—ate too much.”

  Dad chuckles and takes a generous sip of his drink. “Right. So it had nothing to do with—”

  “You overcoming literal impossible odds to become an astronaut?” I force a laugh. “No, not at all. For the record, it’s also not about the fact that we have to uproot our lives in a few months. It’s definitely got nothing to do with how I won’t be able to stream my reports anymore. It’s just a lot to take in, okay?”

  “Maybe they could let him keep doing the videos?” Mom says. “Why don’t you ask them when you go—”

  “I can’t believe this is what we’re talking about right now,” Dad says, splashing the rest of his champagne into the bathroom sink. “Look, I’m sorry you won’t be able to play on social media anymore, but this is real life.”

  I choke back a laugh. “Real life? I have to give up my journalism, plus my entire life, because a reality show says so. You really think what I do is less ‘real’ than StarWatch?”

  My mom’s caught between us in our tiny bathroom. She’s wringing her hands and looking back and forth. Not daring to say anything else. When she and Dad fight, she always knows what to say, never backs down. But now, her face is frozen between panic and helplessness. I know this isn’t good for her anxiety, so I take a deep breath to calm myself.

  I squeeze by her and into the hall and break into a quick walk to my room.

  “Cal,” Dad says, and I stop. It’s short, but not sweet. His voice has an edge of pity to it. “I’ll … I can ask them.”

  “No, it’s fine,” I say. “It’s great, actually. Why would I need to do the one thing I’m good at and actually enjoy, when I could be out there enjoying the Lone Star State? I’ve always loved the allure of Texas. Tripping over Republicans every other step, somehow keeping vegetarian in the land of Tex-Mex and barbecue ribs, it’s a literal dream come true.”

  I’m being selfish right now, and I know it. But this whole thing is born of selfishness. Dad didn’t tell us he was going to apply. He didn’t explain what would happen if he got in. He just plopped a binder on the kitchen table one day. It was his portfolio—I have no idea why his résumé needed to be in a three-ring binder, especially when you could have just as easily scribbled “Delta” on a napkin and used that.

  And then we waited.

  Well, he waited. Mom and I gave him shit, because that was so much easier than accepting that he could actually make it in. He could change our lives, make us regulars on Shooting Stars, which, despite its patriotic and unifying start, slowly devolved into the overdramatic, ratings-hungry reality show it is now. But he never asked if that’s what we wanted.

  “Jesus. Get it together,” he says.

  Looking at my mom’s eyes, I can tell we’re in agreement here.

  “Let’s leave him alone for a bit,” Mom says, voice squeaking, and ushers him away. I can breathe easier, even if just for a second, even though I know what’s about to happen.

  “It’s not my fault he can’t process it. Neither of you seem to get how important this is.” His voice rises. “I’ve worked my whole life for this.”

  “I think you can drop that,” Mom says. Her voice is stronger now. Anxiety be damned, she doesn’t take his shit. “We’ve been together seventeen years, and we all knew you loved space, but you never mentioned considering being an astronaut until you slapped us with that ridiculous binder.”

  I take the opportunity to flee to my bedroom. As I’m shutting the door, though, Dad comes stomping back down the hall.

  “Wait!”

  I do, briefly. I take a deep breath and push out the nicest response I can muster. “I can’t be excited for you right now. I have to go clear out the troll comments on my video, plus my BuzzFeed internship starts on Monday, and I have forms to fill out. We’ll talk later.”

  “Cal, you don’t get it,” Dad says. He looks nervous now. “We don’t have time to wait for you to get on board.”

  A beat, and all the energy gets sapped from the room. My legs feel wobbly. I feel my heart rate spike, and my hand feels slimy on the doorknob. I breathe, but it’s shallow and unfulfilling.

  “We need to start packing tonight,” he says. “They’ve got a house for us.”

  “What do you—”

  “We’re moving on Monday.”

  My insides stop working. I’m experiencing literal—okay, figurative—organ failure right now. I just stare, and blink, and stare again. Then I pull back and unfreeze my body for a second. Just enough to clench my fingers around the doorframe and slam the door in his face.

  I click the button lock and dash to my headphones. I press play on the cassette deck and let the sounds pump through, blocking out the shouting and the expectations and my frustrations.

  I block it all out.

  For a few minutes. The music isn’t working. I can’t concentrate, and everything sounds like noise and makes me tense up. I feel angry and sad, but I don’t know which feeling brings the tears to my eyes faster. I start to cry, but I take off my headphones before I let myself do it. I can’t let him hear.

  My parents resume fighting in the other room. Well, not fighting, actually. It’s a discussion. I hear numbers being thrown out, and words like “movers” and “salary” and know they won’t be settling this anytime soon.

  I pull out my phone and send a text to Deb.

  Can I come down? Need to get out of here for a min

 

She responds in a flash.

  Yeah, we heard the stomping. Door or window?

  I send her an emoji of a window and double-check that my door’s locked. They wouldn’t mind me going down to talk to Deb—it’s only one flight down—but I can’t bear to look at them right now.

  I imagine them coming to check on me and hearing no response. They’d think I was ignoring them, or if they used that little gold key above the doorframe, they’d know I bailed. And they’d stop the fighting for one second, and they’d sigh “oh shit” at the same time. And for once, I wouldn’t be the one trying to make things better, to fix our problems.

  Finally, something would be about me.

  I lift the window, then the screen. I duck out onto the fire escape and feel the wind tear through my body. I welcome the feeling, refreshing and calming, and stretch out on the landing. My eyes scan the world beneath me, all strollers and parents and dogs, rushing home for dinner before the sun finally sets. Bikes and cars and trucks and brick buildings line the avenue. Beyond that, the trees block my view of brownstones.

  This might be the last time I stand out here.

  This might be my last weekend living in Brooklyn.

  When I reach the third floor, I hesitate at the open window. Her sheer curtains are drawn, and I see her silhouette frantically darting back and forth—she’s probably throwing all her dirty laundry in the hamper so I can find a place to sit.

  It hits me so hard I stagger back and lean against the railing: I’m about to tell my best friend that I’m leaving immediately, indefinitely. Probably. Unless there’s some chance Dad’s being majorly pranked.

  She pushes aside the curtains, and I gasp. The moment she sees my face, which must be lined with tears, her jaw drops.

  A familiar pang hits me in the chest. I’ve seen this expression before. I’ve given her this expression before. Last year, I crawled in her window, a panicked mess, to break up with her.

  For some reason, I didn’t ease her into it with talking about us growing apart or going different directions, or wanting to focus on school or exploring other options. These were all phrases I had rehearsed.
  But she was my girlfriend … and my best friend. She deserved more than a weak excuse, so I went right to the point:

  “I kissed Jeremy.”

  We talked it out, and—months later—she accepted my apology. The thing was, Jeremy was always there in the back of my mind. He was the unattainable senior, and I was content with Deb. Unfortunately for her, I found something better than content as I sunk into his lips, the taste of Coors Light on our tongues.

  I found a fire, a passion that I was missing. My identity seems to change by the minute, but I knew I was queer—and Deb did too. The hardest thing for her to accept was that it wasn’t that I didn’t like cishet girls … I just didn’t like her like that, and after dating for three months, I wanted to find someone I did like. And I found Jeremy.

  Two weeks later, Jeremy found someone else.

  “Calvin?” She grabs my hand and pulls me closer. “Come in. What’s—wow, last time I saw you looking like this I had to bring you back from a panic attack so you could break up with me. What’s going on, babe?”

  My breaths aren’t coming easily. I’m suffocating, drowning in the overwhelming pink of her room. The pink beanbag chair with the pink fuzzy pillow and the—why can’t I breathe?—pink rug that I’m somehow lying on now, though I don’t remember crawling in through the window.

  I focus on a point on the ceiling, and I don’t let it go. Breathe in. Breathe out. Slowly, I pull myself together. I’m okay.

  “I’m okay.”

  Deb rolls her eyes. “Yes, I see that.”

  “I’m leaving. On Monday. Dad’s a fucking astronaut.”

  This is when she busts out laughing. Like, I’m still crying, and she is one-hundred-percent losing her shit. I can see her try to hold it together—clenching, biting her lip—but nothing’s working.

  “Oh, god, this is bad. Sorry.” She pauses to grab my arm. “It’s just so fucking unlikely. Your dad’s the least qualified person for this job.”

  I shrug. “I mean, he’s a pilot, I guess.”

  “For Delta.” She leans on that word like it tastes bad in her mouth. “He’s got to be the first nonscientist they’ve picked since, like, the seventies.”

  I decide not to tell her that his degree in aeronautical engineering does make him a scientist.

  “Focus.” I reach out to her, and all the air’s sucked from the room. She breaks eye contact and starts picking at the chipped paint on her toenail. “I’m leaving, Deb. On Monday, apparently. We’re moving to Houston, and I don’t know when I’m coming back. Or if I’m coming back.”

  It’s as if the world reacts to my words. A cloud passes by, casting the window in shade. The pink around me dims. Her lips almost pout as she considers me.

  She’s not laughing anymore.

  So, no, I didn’t love her like that. But I do love her. From the moment we met at the mailbox downstairs, when I was geeking out about the vintage Prince cassette I’d just scored off eBay. She’d just moved in that day, but that didn’t stop her from relentlessly mocking my obsession with cassettes.

  That didn’t curb my enthusiasm. I started rambling about it, about how much smoother cassettes sounded and how they had a quality she could never find in a digital copy or CD. I talked so much, I kind of forgot that my room was a disaster, even after I invited her up. She sat on my bed, which was totally unmade, and just listened.

  She definitely didn’t get it. The cassette thing. But she listened anyway.

  That whole year was spent falling into an easy friendship with her. One where I never had to ask if she was free later; I’d ask her, “What are we doing later?” We spent so much time together, it was like we were dating. Going from friends to more was easy too. Suddenly, we were dating, and it all felt the same.

  The same, though, wasn’t what I wanted. Where I sought fire and excitement, I got the same calm, comfortable relationship we’d always had.

  “What about BuzzFeed?” she asks, cutting through my memories.

  I pause. After my coverage of the midterm election got picked up by the national news, plus one full year of building my following and reputation as a reporter, BuzzFeed News offered me a summer internship to help with video content for their new local New York City feature.

  When I walked into the headquarters, with its yellow walls and couches everywhere, I knew I was somewhere special. With the laughing twentysomethings and their thick-rimmed glasses, phones always up on top of laptops in open meeting spaces. It was a dream. It was supposed to start next week. It was …

  “Not going to happen.” I realize it as I say it. Everything I’ve worked for. A foot in the door with a career in media journalism. Stolen away by the astronauts. “Fuck, this sucks. What do I even tell them?”

  “Tell them you’ll cover the Mars missions. They post a new article about the families like every day.”

  “On the entertainment page. I was supposed to cover city news.” I gesture to the window. “And StarWatch has a gag order on any other video, or really anything, coming out of Clear Lake, Texas. Once Dad signs that contract, I’ll be a part of the show. I won’t even be able to do my FlashFame vids anymore.”

  “That’s (a) not fair, and (b) wait, I just realized you’re going to be on Shooting Stars. Oh my god, Josh Farrow is going to be saying your name, aloud, on TV.”

  I groan. “I can’t even process that you still watch that show. It’s all perfect families, fancy parties, and petty gossip nowadays. We’ll never be able to fit in with those people.”

  The tension balls up in my chest.

  “First of all, it is a fantastic television program.” She pronounces each word with extra force. “Okay, yeah, it’s a little petty. But hey, they’re entertaining at least. Don’t act like you aren’t a little starry-eyed—pun intended. You were just as invested as everyone else until you found out your dad got an interview.”

  “Sure, I covered all the new astronauts and reported on the months-long debate about financing Orpheus before the Senate finally passed that funding bill. They were news stories that mattered.”

  “Well, maybe I think watching astronauts get drunk off champagne before falling face-first into a bush matters too,” she jokes.

  At least, I hope that was a joke.

  Either way, I roll my eyes. “I even did that in-depth report on all the drama NASA caused by buying out every house on the market in Clear Lake, and it got picked up by the Washington Post.”

  She nods, sagely, as I ramble through my frustration.

  Clear Lake City is conveniently close to NASA’s Johnson Space Center. When the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo astronauts—and, of course, all the related teams—relocated here from their respective towns, Clear Lake and a few surrounding areas became known for being the home of astronauts. American heroes who made their front lawns the Hollywood of the South.

  There was more than celebrity appeal then, however, and the same is true now.

  “StarWatch thinks people don’t care about the science of it,” I say. “Plus, the exploration, what it could mean for our planet, anything. It’s so scripted and boring. You know a producer is behind the scenes, stoking the fire or asking pointed questions.”

  She sighs. “We’re getting off track. Forget them—let’s get back to you. At least ask BuzzFeed if you could do the internship from Texas? You might not lose this opportunity if you try. I’m sure they can be flexible. It’s not the Times.”

  “I will,” I say. “It’ll give me something to do on the car ride to Texas.”

  She laughs and punches me in the shoulder. “NASA won’t pay for a jet? Come on!”

  “You know Dad wouldn’t go for that. He’s spent the past decade moving the car for street cleanings twice a week, even though we use it a handful of times a year. He’s not going to get rid of it. He’s going to make us all load up the car and go. Forever.”

  She pulls me into a hug, and I reach around her body and hold her close.

  “What am I going to do witho

ut you?” she asks.

  I know the question isn’t exactly rhetorical. At least once a week, she’ll tap on my window, needing an escape from her family. They fight too. Maybe all parents fight, I don’t know. But with Deb’s parents … their fights are always … scarier. More desperate. The echoed sound of a fist breaking through a particleboard door settles in my head.

  They break her heart, and I fix it. That’s how it’s always gone. Whether it’s splitting vegan frozen yogurt at Pinkberry or impromptu slumber parties, fixing her pain—or at least distracting her from it—puts me at ease.

  A shiver runs through my body as the truth breaks through. Sometimes, it feels like the only thing keeping me stable is the shield I put up. Cal the performer is always put together. Cal the friend is always there to fix your problems.

  I try, but I can’t even picture the real Cal. The one without a carefully planned video schedule and content calendar, the one who has a clear vision of his future, the one without anyone to turn to.

  And I especially can’t picture any version of myself in Clear Lake, Texas.

  I rest my head on Deb’s shoulder and fight back the tears. I’m a little more successful this time, so I get the courage to tell her:

  “I’m really going to miss you, Deb.”

  I nod toward the fire escape, and she follows me out there. We take our usual spots, me a few steps higher than her, the wrought iron crisscrossed grate I sit on hurting my ass. The wind is cutting, though it’s a warm day in spring, and my hair is a disaster.

  It’s all perfect.

  The sun’s almost set, but we could be out here all night for all I care.

  “Everything’s going to change,” I say.

  Deb releases a bark of laughter. “Is that so bad?”

  She bites her lip, and her eyes glisten and puff up. I know Deb could use a change. The only reason Deb is okay now is because she’s working the register at Paper Source, which means she can avoid her family for most of the day and night, depending on the shifts she picks up.

  I know she’d run if she could, but that doesn’t make it any better, for either of us. I wish I could bring her along, to have someone with me on this trip who doesn’t drive me mad like Mom and Dad do.

  “It might not be so bad—god, why am I tearing up right now?” She takes a moment to rub each eye with her sleeve. “I’ll visit you, and you’ll come back when you can. You’ll end up back in Brooklyn eventually, for good, don’t you think?”

  “Oh, um, probably.” I hadn’t yet thought about coming back, really, because I never thought about leaving.

  Too much. “It’s too much,” I say.

  “Promise me …” She points to my phone. “Promise me you won’t stop. Keep streaming all your news stories.

  “You know how fickle fans are. If you take a year off, I’m afraid … once you move back here, you won’t have anything left to come back to.”

  She’s right. Her words slap me across the face, waking some fire within me. I have my next decade planned out meticulously. I have the college brochures on my desk, the SAT prep courses scheduled. I knew exactly how I was getting into my career.

  If I leave, even for a year, I could lose so much.

  “I know it’s against the rules or whatever,” she says, “but I say post everything you can until StarWatch pries that phone from your hands.”

  There’s nothing I can do to change NASA’s mind. There’s nothing I can do to stop this move. The only thing I can control is sitting in the palm of my hand.

  A spark of rebellion warms my soul. It’s not the smartest move, and it could get my family in trouble, but maybe Clear Lake, Texas, has a story out there just waiting for me to uncover.

  Shooting Stars

  Season 1; Episode 10

  EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: The Tucker family’s house has a reputation for being party central when it comes to welcoming new astronauts, honoring achievements, or celebrating holidays. In this episode, we pay a visit to Grace, Tony, Leon, and Katherine Tucker to get an inside look at their home and to learn more about the sacrifices the family’s made for the Orpheus project. (First aired 7/17/2019)

  “Good evening to all our viewers. I’m Josh Farrow, and I’d like to welcome you to another new episode of Shooting Stars. Tonight I’ll be taking you on a very special tour through the Tucker family home. But first, I thought it would be nice to catch up with our astronaut family du jour: Grace Tucker, her husband, Tony, and their children, Leon and Katherine. It’s been a few months since we last got to chat, Grace, isn’t that right?”

  “Yes, and I can’t believe how much has changed in such a short time. I want to thank all the viewers for their help. Without your support, and the thousands of calls and emails to Senate and Congress members … well, let’s just say we might not be sitting here right now.”

  “Couldn’t have said it better myself. So, last time I was here, we did a quick interview with Grace on that couch, but we only talked business. I want to know more about you all as a family. Leon, with a mother like Grace, you have a lot to live up to. However, you seem to be doing so in your own unique way. By this point we all know about your great talent for gymnastics—in fact, Tony was just telling me about your impromptu gym session today. No pressure, of course, but a few of our fans want to know, do you think we’ll be seeing you compete anytime soon?”

  “I’m … not so sure about that. I’ve only been back once so far. Still looking for the right trainer. Kat dragged me to a gymnastics center in Houston earlier today, and I spent some time on the rings, hit the mat, and … face-planted a few times. I’m not quite so sure I’m competition material anymore.”

  “My brother’s being a little too humble. See, back in Indiana, Leon was basically guaranteed a spot in the USA Gymnastics Elite Squad for his age group. But when we moved here, it was hard for all of us to get into the right rhythm. Plus, our new school is a lot more competitive—academically, I mean. Having said all that, we all know he’s still competition material.”

  “That’s great to hear—and I love to see the supportive bond you two have. My sister and I are a year apart too, but we’ve always been far too competitive to have that kind of relationship! Before we go to break, I wanted to let viewers know we’ve actually acquired some fan-submitted videos of the Tucker kids at the gym. Our viewers can go to StarWatch.TV to see those videos. Once you’re there, read on to take a look back on how Leon’s promising career in gymnastics may have been cut short years before a potential Team USA Olympics run. As we know, he’s not the only family member whose life or career was affected by the Orpheus missions. With a full StarWatch pass, you’ll get access to a new miniseries that takes an in-depth look at the astronauts’ loved ones and the dreams they’ve left behind.”''',

      'The Gravity of Us',
      ''' The weekend goes too fast. Way too fast. A few days ago, I never thought I’d leave my nook of a bedroom, with the tiny bookshelf, twin bed, and tape deck. But now, it really hits me.

  I’m leaving Brooklyn.

  “Look, buddy,” Dad starts.

  I hate when he calls me that. So I just keep looking into my bowl of ice cream. I shuffle my feet out of habit, feeling them stick to the stone floor just slightly.

  This shop’s been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, serving the same four ice-cream flavors. Unlike a lot of Brooklyn—new Brooklyn, at least—it’s a no-frills kind of place. Ice cream in the summer. Soup in the winter. And really, both foods usually warm my heart.

  Today, though, my chest is too heavy. There are some pains even ice cream can’t fix.

  “I want you to know that … I get it. I know how hard this can be. I was a military brat—my parents moved me all over the place, and I hated it every single time. I resented them for it, and I know you will too, but I hope one day you’ll understand.”

  “And I hope …,” I start, not sure how to express the jumble that’s in my chest … how to say it in a way that will make him take my work seriously for once

. “I hope you know what this is costing me. I know you’ve always treated my videos as a hobby, and I’m sure it looks that way for you. You don’t even watch them. So you don’t see the time I put into my reports. You don’t see the folders I have on my drive—portfolios to help me get into journalism schools after I graduate, all my research on writing scholarships to help pay for college. It took so much work to build this following, and having to abandon something like this just … sucks.”

  “I know.” Dad takes a big bite of ice cream. I follow suit. “I should have been more honest with you two in the beginning. That way you could have worked this into your plan. I know how you think—though, I have no idea where you got the planning gene, with how your mom and I are. It’s something I’m going to work on. But I need you to get on board, and help your mom do the same, okay?”

  I shrug. A half-hearted gesture is all I can offer right now.

  Pushing aside the rest of my ice cream, I take one last look at the small shop. I’m going to miss the sticky floor, the water-stained ceiling tiles, the enormous plastic ice-cream cone outside the storefront—the paint is chipping, yet it still manages to creepily light up at night.

  Right now, movers are loading boxes into the truck. Boxes containing my entire life are about to be flung across the country. I sigh, and the chill of the ice cream finally catches up to me, until a firm hand grips my shoulder.

  Dad’s voice is almost a whisper. “I’m going to miss it here too.”

  “I still can’t believe you get to meet the astronauts,” Deb says while Dad loads our suitcases into the trunk of our car. “You’ll get to meet Grace Tucker and Mark Bannon. Like, actually speak to them. Maybe touch them?”

  I roll my eyes. “I think we’ll take it slow, at first. What with them being double my age, and always on the news.”

  “Oh, shut it.” She slaps me on the arm. “You know what I mean.”

  The thought of meeting Mark Bannon, one of the first astronauts picked for the project, immediately intimidates me. I did one report on him that focused on his advocacy for the space program, back before we even knew if Orpheus V would earn the funding to get off the ground. It got me a ton of new followers—the same ones who are probably complaining that I don’t do those updates anymore.
  I know him as a Hulk-like presence who still somehow always looks ready for the cameras. He’s got an animated, passionate personality reminiscent of the Apollo astronauts, and I wonder if the rumors are true, about him and Grace vying for the same spot on the Orpheus V mission.

  I think back to Grace’s Shooting Stars interview—which I only watched for research purposes, and maybe because I was a little interested in these new pseudocelebrities—and something about her stubbornness inspired me. How down-to-earth she was, when Josh Farrow wanted her to reveal some tension between the astronauts.

  Maybe there’s more to this mission. Maybe there are real people under this facade. A real story. The rush creeps back inside me. Blood pulses through my veins.

  I pull up the latest issue of Time on my phone and see the Tuckers’ faces beaming up at me. Deb, a notorious space invader, creeps up behind me.

  “God, they’re beautiful,” she says.

  My gaze drifts to their son, Leon Tucker. His smoldering stare makes my pulse spike. She’s not wrong.

  “Could you imagine us on that cover? Me and my parents? We’ll never pull this off.” I clear my throat. “You know where you watch a movie or read a book or something, and the main character switches schools and is worried about not fitting in, or making new friends? I’m not … I’m not feeling any of that.”

  She considers me softly, with a subtle arch of her brow. So I continue.

  “I’ll make friends—or I won’t, I don’t know. People generally suck anyway—but my family won’t fit in. Mom’s anxiety’s gotten so bad she barely leaves home anymore, except to go walk around Prospect Park. And they’ve been fighting so much since Dad applied. The other astronauts are all on another level, and their kids are too. Am I a near-Olympic-level gymnast like Leon Tucker? I just feel so … inadequate.”

  “Calvin, you have like half a million FlashFame followers. You’ve given reports that literally helped sway an election. And even if you have to give it up, you still got the chance at a BuzzFeed internship as a seventeen-year-old—they don’t just give those out.” She places an arm on my shoulder and lets her words sink in. “You’re more than adequate, babe. You’ll fit in. All of you. But you’ll have to let them in too. You’ve got to get behind this mission—I mean, after the shitshow America’s become over the past few years, we all actually have something to rally behind and be proud of. We’re going to fucking Mars. And in whatever way NASA deems appropriate, you, your mom, and your dad are going to help us get there.”

  “I know,” I say. And I do.

  In this moment, just barely, the sparkle of the mission leaves me breathless. To be a part of history, to play a tiny role in this massive scientific undertaking.

  I keep my voice low so my parents can’t overhear. “I thought if I ignored everything that’s happened over the past year … I don’t know, I guess I thought that if I didn’t put any faith in it—”

  “Your dad wouldn’t get picked?”

  “No, not that. I thought if I could stay grounded and make this feel unreal for all of us, then I could be the realist who helped … put Dad back together when he eventually got the crushing no.”

  “Noble,” she says. “But that’s not your job.”

  “It’s a compulsion,” I say. “I want things to be … right. People to be happy.”

  “But sometimes that bites you in the ass. Like when you told me about Jeremy,” she says unflinchingly, “and then I had to hold your hand and coach your breathing after I found out you cheated on me. But you wouldn’t leave—you needed me to be okay, you needed to fix our relationship.”

  “Are you still pissed at me?”

  “Oh my god,” she says. “You’re doing it again! No, I wouldn’t be this flippant if I was still holding a grudge, Calvin.”

  Deb throws her arms around me, and I’m enveloped in a floral scent. Not like roses or lavender, but like a fall-scented candle in the middle of a potpourri bowl. It’s comforting. But I can’t bring myself to hug her back.

  She continues. “But you couldn’t magically fix us. I just needed time. And you can’t fix your parents.” When I lay my head on her shoulder, the tears soak into her shirt.

  “So let’s make a game plan,” Deb says after a moment of silence. “We’ve only got one year left of school, unless you fail out, which would fuck up all my planning, so don’t do that. Depending on when our graduations are, we can find a place as early as May. I’ve got a job, and maybe your family would be rich by then, so we could find a place together in Brooklyn.”

  “What kind of place are we going to find?”

  “I don’t know, some closet in Bed Stuy? We can live in Coney Island for all I care. I just need out.”

  The desperation in her voice hits me. “Deb, what’s going on?”

  There’s a pause, where my heart makes its way down into my stomach. She doesn’t hesitate. She’s not like this.

  “It’s just not great at home lately,” she says, and I get the feeling that’s the understatement of the millennium. She drops her voice to a whisper. “Okay, well, it’s awful actually. My parents have been around all the time since my pa got laid off. Unemployment is only going so far.”

  “I thought he was going off on his own?” I ask. Her dad was a designer for a big corporation and said this layoff was the perfect excuse to start his own design firm.

  “That’s it. He’s got a few clients, he has business cards, he’s draining his unemployment buying new computers and software, but he’s not even registering his company. Mom’s always fighting with him, because having income and taking in unemployment is illegal, but fuck, we still barely have enough money to live off.” She clears her throat. “They’ve been using my money. Some of it, for groceries and rent and stuff.”

  “That’s not fair!” I shout. “You work really hard for that.”

  “I know, I know, but they kind of have a point—I’m the only one with a steady income, and they’ve taken care of me for so long, I should help a little, I guess. But Cal, I don’t even know if we have health insurance anymore.”

  “And you think you’ll be able to just up and leave them next year? How will you even save up the money if they’re taking it?”

  She sighs, long and slow. “I don’t know yet. But I’ll figure it out, even if I have to crack open my radiator and hide it in there.”

  “Don’t worry,” I say. There’s one way I can fix this situation. “I’m coming back as soon as I can. If you can just wait until I graduate. I’ll be eighteen; there are plenty of schools up here on my list. NYU, St. John’s, Columbia—I’d need a scholarship, probably, but I think we could actually make it work.”

  “Cal, honey?” Mom joins our conversation and gestures lightly toward the car. Her face is strained, almost like she’s in pain. I know she’s sad. I know she hates the thought of leaving our home. I see the way she tenses her shoulders and grits her teeth.

  And I hate that I want to beg her to stay and keep me here. Let Dad do this on his own.

  “Are you almost ready to say goodbye?”

  “We don’t have to do this,” I say. It’s almost a whisper, and I feel Deb’s embarrassment from here. But I have to say this. “NASA’s making Dad move there. Not all of us too. It’s not fair—have you even googled Houston? It’s a cesspool.”

  “Believe me, I have. Clear Lake City is different, but it’s beautiful in a suburban way. And I think I understand it. Why they’re making everyone move to the same town where the first astronauts lived. I can’t even go on Facebook without seeing all my college friends post about them. And though I’m so sad to be leaving my hometown of forty-three years, it’s something I have to do. It’s something we have to do, for your dad.” Her feathered brown hair covers half her face. She places a palm on my shoulder and gives me a smile that never quite reaches its full potential.

  “Plus,” she adds, “with your dad’s temper, I give it a week before he gets kicked out.”

  We laugh

, but once the laughter fades into awkward silence, I know it’s time. We’re one drive away from a new life. Which means I have three days and a twenty-four-hour drive to figure out how to exist in the town of astronauts.

  Outside the car, I give Deb a hug and a kiss goodbye. Both are short, and awkward, partially because of the move and partially because of my mom’s eyes lingering on us.

  “Love you,” I say.

  Deb smiles. “I know.”

  I settle into the back seat and roll down the window, savoring the last couple of minutes with my best friend. But we don’t say anything. Really, what is there to say at this point? Except, just, goodbye.

  Once we’re on the road, I busy myself by pulling up all the information I can find about the Orpheus program. Its goals, what it means for our country—outside of the entertainment factor, that is. Orpheus V will take six astronauts to Mars, where they’ll build a temporary Martian base, execute some elaborate excavation plans, and perform scientific experiments. Not long after that, Orpheus VI and VII will be on their way, bringing supplies to Mars to set up a permanent base, while Orpheus V sweeps back toward Earth, carrying a ton of soil and rock samples.

  I switch to the full Time story and see variations on the Tucker family portrait. Their eyes stare back at me; their faces hide all emotion behind them. Where I look for panic, I see reserved excitement. Practiced excitement. Grace Tucker’s two teens play their roles well—Leon, the serious, Olympics-bound brother (who is supremely hot, if that wasn’t clear), and Katherine, the precocious sister.

  It makes me wonder … what role will I play?

  The article has a few more pictures spread out of the family together, posed on sets from the sixties. It reminds me of some of the old magazines I’ve seen. A wholesome family candid, with the family around the small box television with its wooden frame and obnoxious antenna.

  “Do you know much about the sixties? Like, the Apollo missions?” I ask.

  Dad fake swerves the car and gasps. I roll my eyes. Mom shakes her head but doesn’t start a fight.

  “You’re asking about the sixties? You’re asking me and not Siri?”

  “Dad, no one actually uses Siri. And whatever, I’ll just look it up,” I say, knowing he will absolutely not let me do that, now I’ve shown an interest.

  “So clearly, I wasn’t around then, but the sixties and early seventies were the golden age of spaceflight.” I catch his eye, and I can see the sparkle from here. “See, the astronauts moved to Clear Lake and the surrounding areas, and they all lived together, partied together, mourned together, and, eventually, some of them took America to the moon and back. It was a scene, like nothing that’s ever happened before. I know you don’t care for Shooting Stars, but even back then, the town was always swamped with the press. You couldn’t get a car down the street to save your life on launch days because of all the news trucks and fans. It was like Hollywood or something.”

  “You showed me those articles once before, I think.”

  “I have all the good ones in the storage unit. Not doing much good there, I guess. But the country was obsessed with the astronauts. The whole country held their breath as mathematics and sheer brilliance brought back the Apollo 13 crew from the explosion that could have taken their lives. And they mourned when the Apollo 1 flight crew were burned alive on the test pad, thanks to a vulnerable wire and a pure oxygen atmosphere.” A silence fills the car. “They were the true American heroes, all of them.”

  I listen to him talk, and I’m mesmerized. He cares so much, but I never really knew. I mean, he had a few books on this; he obviously loved flying planes … which is also why this eight-billion-mile road trip was utterly confusing for me. Was this really his dream all along? Was I never paying attention?

  “That’s cool, Dad.”

  “You think so?”

  My mom laughs at this and places her hand softly on my dad’s leg. I feel the connection in the car. It’s warm, and for one moment, we’re all smiling. I can’t even think of the last time we were content to be around one another. No shouting. No slammed doors, no loud music to drown it all out.

  I know it can’t last. I know my parents, and a part of me wonders if this truly is happiness or defeated acceptance. But I savor the moment as I pull up old paparazzi photos and Shooting Stars clips. I start taking note of everyone’s expressions: crisp, practiced, perfect. Are they all that good at faking it? Or do they actually buy into all this? I’m looking for a flaw, but I can’t find the reality behind the show. Until I come upon a candid shot from one of the parties—looks like another mixer at the Tuckers’ house. Grace has on a sleek, formfitting red cocktail dress; her laugh looks so pure it makes you want to join in. But in the background—

  “Leon,” I say.

  Mom turns around. “What’s that?”

  “Oh, I mean, nothing.” I return to the image. “Just thinking.”

  He’s sitting on their couch, the glow of his phone illuminating his face. But he’s looking up at the spectacle of it all, just past the camera. And there’s a brooding there that pulls me in.

  I’m interested in him purely from a journalistic standpoint, I remind myself, even as his narrowed eyes and sharp jaw pierce through my chest. It’s easy to crush on him for being insanely good looking, sure, but what appeals to me the most is his expression.

  There’s a fire that burns behind those eyes, and I cling to hope that maybe he’s a cynic, like me. My breath catches, and my hand reaches out to the picture. I might be imagining it, but I still cling onto the hope that someone in that suburb could actually be my ally.

  Or maybe … maybe something more.''',

      'The Gravity of Us',
      ''' Praise me, for I have lived through a twenty-four-hour car ride. I have lived through two nights in crappy hotels—believe me, the best hotel in Higginsville, Mississippi, is roughly a negative-three-star hotel by New York standards. I survived staying in the same hotel room as my parents, in tiny rooms with thin walls and two double beds.

  I have lived through figurative hell, and my reward? Arriving in literal hell. Clear Lake, Texas, at ninety-two degrees.

  I step out of the car and survey my new hometown. The heat is wet—the humidity clings to my body, to my lungs, to my eyelids. We’ve pulled into a park to stretch our legs as we wait for our NASA rep to come show us to our new house.

  There’s a swing set, a few of those rocking ponies, and an old metal slide all on a bed of wood chips. I try to imagine the kids of the Mercury astronauts from the early sixties—Astrokids, I think they were called—playing in this same park. I imagine a picture-perfect mom holding an infant in her arm while pushing a toddler in the little swing that looks like a plastic sumo uniform.

  Standing here in this swampy mess of a day, I wonder how much they had to fake it for the cameras. Put on a happy face, retouching their makeup between diaper changes and photo shoots. The astronauts had their jobs—to get us to the moon—but their wives had it even harder. They had to fit in, raise their children, take care of the house, the lawn, the gardens, the cooking, the baking, the parties, all while caking on the makeup.

  The Astrokids must have played their parts just as well—rambunctious when the magazines wanted them to be, calm and pensive at other times. I groan when I think about playing that part now.

  “Cal!” Dad shouts. He’s in good spirits, which is the only positive thing to come from this sweaty nightmare. “The NASA guy is pulling up now.”

  Dad’s smile reminds me again of the absence of fighting between all of us. It’s like we’re back to the pseudonormalcy of our pre-NASA days. Dad has plenty of reasons to be happy, but why is my mom smiling too? Does she not want to shatter his fragile happiness? Is she pushing down her feelings? Her angst about being taken away from Brooklyn, her irritation for the duties that are about to be added on top of the fifty hours a week she spends coding? The spouses aren’t like the astronaut wives of the sixties—prim, perfect, calm, sober—but there’s still an expectat

ion.

  Or is she actually … happy? Hopeful?

  That thought makes me nauseous. She was supposed to be on my side.

  The “NASA guy” gets out of his car, and quickly makes his way to Dad. He’s supremely put together, with his short but styled blond hair, checkered shirt buttoned to the top with no tie, and gray slacks that fade into brown boots. The fact he’s in anything but shorts makes me sweat doubly on his behalf. Are Texans just immune to this?

  He shakes my hand as soon as I get to the group.

  “Brendan,” he says. “You must be Calvin Junior.”

  I offer a faint smile. “That’s Calvin,” I say, pointing to my dad. “Call me Cal.”

  “Got it. Well, do you want to see your new house?” he asks. “Get ready for it. NASA’s been big on bringing back the retro appeal.”

  He rolls his eyes briefly, but his smirk says it all: it may be over the top, but it’s worth it.

  The town’s not awful. It’s even kind of cute. There’s a different kind of history here. Modern history. Brooklyn has homes that date back 150 years—even our apartment had the original hardwood floors from the early 1900s.

  We pull up to our house, and I take in the pristine lawn, which fades into the precisely cut bushes lining the house. It’s been so recently painted you can see a glossy shine. The windows sparkle; the mailbox has our last name etched into it.

  There’s something so real about this place, and it counters everything I got from the park. Seeing the pictures, reading the stories, it all seemed perfect.

  And this kind of … is perfect. I watch my dad take it all in, his smile gone—his expression replaced with a look of pure wonderment.

  If I’m feeling this way, I can only imagine the thoughts going through his head.
   “As I’m sure you know, we’ve got a little … media problem here,” Brendan says as he unlocks the door to our new house and steps inside. “Mostly local news, people looking for anything to trend. A few amateurs who want to sell footage to StarWatch, which is a whole other beast you’ll need to prepare for. But there are strict rules, even for StarWatch: They get full filming rights inside the astronauts’ houses—within reason, of course—and at the space station, but at the end of the day, it’s your home. You decide whether to let them in, keep them outside, or kick them out.”

  Brendan and I share a smile, and there’s a strange comfort in having clear boundaries and a little bit of control over our new life.

  “So why isn’t anyone here now?” Dad asks, disappointment hitting his face. Like he’s actually looking forward to getting assaulted by the press.

  Brendan laughs. “NASA’s holding a press conference now and mentioned important updates, so every camera in the city is there. The media team tricked them into thinking we’re announcing the final astronaut, basically, so they didn’t swarm you right away. Don’t worry, we’ll let you settle in first.”

  I hear my mom’s sigh of relief from here. When our eyes meet, a quirk of a smile hits her face. Even if Dad doesn’t end up on a flight, this is going to be a wild ride.

  “Does everyone who works at NASA have this problem?” I ask.

  “Well, I don’t. Since the news isn’t very excited about the soil samples I work on.” He chuckles, and ends with a high-pitched huff. “But the astronauts have to deal with it, all of them. They’re—you’re—the interesting ones.”

  “I mean, soil can be interesting, I guess?”

  “My team thinks so, but I doubt the general public does. Not yet at least.” He shrugs. “Rovers send back a ton of great data, but they can only do so much—we’ll get the first samples back after the Orpheus VI flyby, where we can do real tests, study the soil in a lab, that stuff.”

  If there’s one thing I know about the “general public,” it’s that no self-professed media pro actually knows what the public is interested in. Sometimes trial and error is worth a shot, but it’s not surprising StarWatch would choose glamour and prestige over … dirt.

  After following him inside, I take my first refreshing breath. The cool air makes my skin prickle all over, in the best way. The place is sterile, new. Foreign.

  My dad paces around the living room, where a brand-new television sits on a midcentury-modern sideboard. A light-colored plush couch faces a retro coffee table flanked by two accent chairs.

  Okay, this is a pretty cool house.

  The whole place balances vintage personality with modern appliances. A record player sits on a bookshelf, with a collection of vintage records at its side. They really went all in on this retro thing. If you replaced that record player with a tape deck, I might be kind of here for it.

  “Your lawn is your own. There’s a special number for the local police on the fridge. The media isn’t that bad, usually. But they’ll only get worse as we get closer to Orpheus V launch.”

  I take in this moment of peace, knowing it’ll be my last in a while, and follow Brendan to my room. I throw my bag on my new bed, say I’m going to change, and shut the door. I find my dresser—this is where my cassette deck will go, I’ve decided—and I sit and lean against it, slumping down.

  I take a few deep breaths. Admitting I like our new home, even this town, feels like I’m abandoning my old life.

  I pull out my phone and open the FlashFame app. Then I close it. I know the rules, I’ve read Dad’s contract—to stay consistent with the narrative arc set by the Shooting Stars host and producers, no streamed or recorded video is to be shared publicly without prior consent and guidance from StarWatch Media LLC.

  Meaning, they don’t necessarily want me to shut down my accounts. But they want to control it—which is even worse. The pang in my gut gets stronger as I type out a text to Deb.

  I think I’m going to do it. I mean, technically, I haven’t signed anything, right? They can’t sue me or whatever, right?

  … right?

  I planned on updating on the way down and telling my followers I was going on a brief social media hiatus, but I wasn’t able to do it in the car, and the rest stops and hotel rooms only provide so much privacy—meaning, none at all.

  But now that I’m here, knowing that my dream is flickering like a dying candle, I can’t go on any hiatus. I can’t—no, I won’t let StarWatch control me.

  I clear my throat and stare at myself in the camera. My dark hair covers my eyes, a cowlick pushing my hair up in the back. Not my hottest moment, but this will be short.

  As soon as I hit the LIVE button, the viewers tab starts climbing. I let it pause for a minute, allowing my followers to react to the notification they all got on their phones before I start. I smile and point to my cowlick comically as the hundreds of viewers become thousands. In the middle of the day on a Wednesday. Who are these people? I wonder. Why do they care?

  And then I don’t care why they care, because I enjoy being a little famous. My core tightens again, at the thought of being forced to shut my account down. To give up everything I’ve worked for. By the time I got back to New York, I’d have … nothing.

  “Hi, everyone,” I say, voice squeaking, after the viewers tab hits two thousand. “I, um, have one hell of an update for you all, so sit tight.”

  I feel the rush flow through me. Once again, there’s a story out there to break. And I’m doing it myself.

  “Let’s cut the intro,” I say, deciding to rip off the bandage. “You’ve all started to notice I’ve been dodging questions when it comes to NASA and the Orpheus missions, and it’s time I told you why. The twentieth and final astronaut added to Project Orpheus is none other than … Calvin Lewis. No, not me, my father, Calvin Lewis Sr. I’m coming to you live from Clear Lake, Texas, where we’ve just relocated. Recognize this dresser? This room? No? Well, I don’t either, but if I have my way, both of us are going to see a lot of it in the future, so get ready.”

  I get up and walk around the room, collapsing on the foam mattress. I hold the camera high above my head.

  “So, yes, I may have broken a big news story just now, but if you all don’t mind, I need to turn this into a personal story. My father—an airline pilot turned astronaut, apparently—forced the family on a three-day road trip to Texas instead of putting us on a plane. I don’t get it either, but I do have a very thorough review for the Higginsville Holiday Inn off Route 49 in Mississippi. As much as I love family time”—I pause for effect—“I can not handle another road trip like this.”

  I spend the next five or ten minutes recapping my road trip from hell in all its gory (boring) detail, until my mom peeks her head in the door. “Are you …?” she mouths before taking in a sharp breath. “Never mind. Put that down and come outside with us. Now.”

  “Please stand by,” I say robotically to my phone and peek through the window. A few cars line the streets, staying out of our driveway, and my dad and Brendan stand there staring at them.

  “Well, that was fast. I should have mentioned this earlier, but I may have just broken a lot of rules. I’ll give you the full update tonight … if StarWatch doesn’t murder me by then. Wish me luck.”

  I stop streaming and leave the room, ignoring the gnawing in my stomach that I’m not ready for whatever’s coming.

  The mood shifts when I step outside.

  The air-conditioning that cooled me off apparently gave me temperature amnesia, because I’m shocked by the curtain of heat I just dipped under.

  Standing on the blacktop driveway by our car, a little stunned, is my dad. He just stares at the street while reporters buzz around their news vans like flies, making cameras appear as if from nowhere.

  Mom sighs loudly. We make eye contact, and I can see the strain on her, the tension in her facial expression.

  “You should go. I’ll get Dad.” I nod to make her feel confident

I can take care of this, and she darts back inside.

  I can’t tell my dad’s expression from behind, but I see him go rigid. He’s never been the center of attention, outside of making the announcements as copilot on his flights. And for that, he can hide behind the cockpit. He can’t hide here, where the sun highlights every flaw and accents every doubt.

  He had the foresight to wear a clean shirt at least.

  “Crap,” Brendan says. “Okay, um. I’m not usually the person who deals with this. I’ll make a call.”

  The realization hits me in waves. I did this.

  I broke a national news story.

  It was a small act of rebellion, which is not entirely uncharacteristic of me—like when I slipped past guards at City Hall to attend a press conference to grill the NYC Housing Authority on a mass of broken elevators in their public housing projects.

  But that wasn’t for purely selfish reasons. The pang in my gut turns to fire. This is my calling, and I won’t let StarWatch get in the way. Sometimes, you have to take your future into your own hands.

  And one way or another, I just did that.

  Only, I didn’t think about what that would mean for my family.

  “What do you want to do?” I ask Dad. There’s a firmness in my voice that I didn’t know I had in me. “Should I get Mom back out here? Or should we hide inside?”

  My shallow breaths start to make me feel light-headed.

  Dad turns to me for a second and considers my question as one producer starts her report.

  “We’re here at the house of the newest astronaut for Project Orpheus, Calvin Lewis Sr., whose son is widely known thanks to his following on the social media platform FlashFame. Calvin—senior, that is—is assumed to be the final astronaut selected before NASA launches its preparations for Orpheus V. The lucky six astronauts on that mission, poised to be the first humans to set foot on Mars, are still to be determined.”

  My stomach sours, and I feel the tension claw through my shoulders. We need to move fast if we want to get out of here with no notoriety. A solid smile. A brief wave. And we duck inside. But they’re recording, and I can’t shout that instruction to my dad, who’s stopped, standing like a dope with his head pivoting back and forth from me to the camera.

  And I see why.

  And my chest falls.

  I knew they saw my FlashFame video. But I was wholly unremarkable with my almost-half-a-million viewers in New York City. Not here. Not to these small news stations. They know what happens when they put a clip of me online: all my fans will watch it. The cameras are on me.

  Which means, they didn’t come here just to see my dad.

  They came here for me too.''',

      'The Gravity of Us',
      ''' To hell with a graceful exit, I think as Dad rushes past me and into the house, slamming the door so I’m stuck outside. That was on camera!

  So I smile and pretend it’s one of my videos. I smile because it’s the only thing holding me and this family together, and I hope the cameras were too` focused on me to get the full effect of Dad’s tantrum. If he loses his cool in there, which he will, the mics might pick it up.

  Please don’t shout.

  Please don’t shout.

  Without putting too much thought into the matter, I go into damage-control mode. I force my legs to move—they’re stiff and they ache from being held so tightly. I paste a smile on my face. At first, it’s strained, but as my limbs loosen, my face does too. By the time I’m at the end of the driveway, I’ve got as close to a natural grin as I can pull off.

  The reporter stays on the sidewalk—she knows she’s not allowed to come closer—so there are a few feet between us. She’s got that Hillary Clinton look, with an immaculate solid blue pantsuit. Her smile is practiced; her arm is outstretched.

  “Cal Lewis, I’m Gracie Bennett from KHOU-TV. We were thrilled to see your announcement about moving down here, as Houston doesn’t get many viral superstars in our midst. Congrats to your father and the family on this exciting adventure. So, we’ve got to ask—can we expect any Houston weekend roundups in your future? Are you going to give us the inside scoop on the astronauts’ lives?”

  I chuckle—it’s forced, but everything’s forced right now, so give me a break. My mind scrambles for a way to redirect the conversation back to my dad, and NASA. “I, well, I’m not sure yet. All I know is my dad’s so excited to join the ranks of great astronauts like Jim Lovell, John Glenn, and to be living in the same town as they did—it means a lot. To all of us.”

  She gives me that soft head tilt and pleasant smirk that you get when the other person starts to see you as some teddy bear. Adorable, I see her thinking. I groan internally.

  I’m not sure what else to say, but I’m stopped short when I notice someone approaching the cameras from the corner of my eye. As her shoes clack on the sidewalk, her lavender sun dress billows in the soft breeze. It’s Grace Tucker. She takes off her sunglasses, and even I’m a little starstruck. She turns to the camera.

  “Grace, hello! What do you think about—”

  Grace cuts in. “We’re all so thrilled to have the Lewis family joining us. We’d say more, but I’m too excited to introduce my family to them, and I can’t wait any longer. ’Bye, now!”

  I wave goodbye, and Grace reaches for my arm.

  “You’re welcome down at the station anytime, Cal!” the reporter calls after me. “Remember, K-H-O-U!”

  I let Grace guide me back into the house. I stop short at the door when I hear the yelling. We make eye contact, and I don’t want this to ruin her first impression, so I say:

  “Sorry, we didn’t realize they’d be on us like that. It really surprised them.”

  She nods and smiles and we pretend she’s accepting my words at face value, but then I step inside and announce over Dad: “We’ve got a visitor!”

  Silence.

  Recognition.

  Awkwardness.

  I see Dad go through these phases like they were the five stages of grief. That’s two embarrassments for him today. I wish I could tell him that it’s not my fault the cameras panned to me. That I didn’t want him to have to share the attention. I only wanted to tell my story, and not let some contract he signed get in the way of that.

  “Grace. Or, um, Mrs. Tucker.” My dad crosses the floor to the doorway and offers his hand for her to shake. “It’s nice to meet you.”

  “Same, same. And please, just call me Grace.” She takes a look around the house, and she runs her finger across a recently polished vintage typewriter. “How do you like the decor here? It takes a while to get used to, but it really is beautiful. Anyway, it’s a pleasure to meet you all.”

  “It’s, well, better than I could have imagined.” Dad gestures to us, briefly. “This is Becca, my wife, and Cal, my son.”

  “Becca,” she repeats. Then she turns to me and smiles. “And I actually know this one. My daughter Kat has been a follower of yours for years now. I heard they were bringing your family up here, but I didn’t know it would be today. Lucky that Kat saw your video and told me. I came as quickly as I could.” She turns to my parents. “The—for lack of a better term—paparazzi can be hell here.”

  Dad glares at me. “You posted a video? Is that why—why they knew we were here? You know the rules about that.”

  “I decided to sidestep the rules,” I say weakly. My cheeks flush, and I suddenly realize there are three pairs of eyes aimed right at me, judging me. I want to take a walk, but I can’t even escape with all the news vans out there. Maybe I can outrun them. “But I can fix this. Let me go out and see if they’re still here. S-sorry.”

  As I’m leaving, I hear Grace warn me not to go outside, but I don’t care, and my speechless parents don’t protest. I can’t be in this house anymore.

  I know I can fix this, even if I’m not sure how just yet.

  When I open the door, I’m struck by the media circus in front of our place. The number of cars, vans, cameras, and reporters has tripled. I free

ze as they all point their cameras at me, but a thrill pumps through my veins. It’s the same rush I feel when I give my reports, but it feels bigger somehow. Why would America care about me? Just because I’m the newest character on this obscene reality show? Because my dad has a one-in-four shot at making it on Mars?

  It doesn’t make sense.

  “Hey, um, Cal?” a voice calls out from next door.

  A second person’s gasp falls out behind him. “Oh my god, it’s really him.”

  My cheeks flush as I turn and see the two teens from the Tucker family portrait staring at me. Both of them are immaculate and prepared for this life, with easy smiles and a confident gait. They’re wearing pressed clothes, dressed up a little too much for school.

  “I’m Leon,” the guy says, extending a hand. His posture is too tight, his expression too practiced. “It’s nice to meet you.”

  His voice is a little loud, and I guess it’s so the microphones pick it up. It makes me cringe, but when you’re standing in front of perfection—even when you look like a sweaty mess who hasn’t showered in days—you just have to do your best to fit in.

  “Good to meet you too.”

  An uncomfortable pause lingers between us. We’re making eye contact, and I’m so lost in his gaze I almost forget about the hundred thousand people who will be watching this interaction.

  “We came as soon as we heard,” the girl says. “I’m Katherine, a pleasure to meet you.”

  Though there are three of us, they’ve naturally angled their bodies out in a way that makes them look like they’re in a stage performance—all our bodies tilt toward the cameras. In this moment, I wonder how many rounds of media training they had to go through to act like this. So composed and polished next to each other.

  My smile starts to fade, as these don’t seem like the people I want to be friends with.

  The thrill’s long gone now, and all that’s left is this awkward energy.

  “Right,” I say. “So we’ve all met.”

  Silence cuts through us for a split second longer, until Leon bursts with laughter. His sister and I follow closely behind, and for one brief second, Leon hunches over and puts his hand on my shoulder. I feel his grip, even after his hand leaves my body, and despite the heat, a chill goes straight down my back.
  “Sorry,” he whispers. “I know it’s awkward with all the cameras.”

  “Anyway,” Kat says, regaining some of her composure. Her voice is soft, like she’s no longer performing for an audience. “The van at ten-o’-clock? That’s StarWatch. And they’re going to insist on interviewing the family.”

  StarWatch is here. It takes a while for it to settle in. Will their cameras be on me? How is Mom going to handle the constant attention? How much will it take for Dad’s composure to break?

  “And we were thinking,” Leon says, “there’s a path that goes between our houses that the reporters can’t use. We can sneak away and hide out in the playground just off the trail. That is, unless you want to be subjected to StarWatch on your first day here …”

  I look back and forth, and my head starts shaking a clear no without my brain giving the command. The only way I can fix this and give the focus back to my dad is by leaving.

  Okay, and partially it’s just that I want out of here as soon as humanly possible.

  “Is Mom in there?” Katherine asks, and I nod. “You two go around back. I’m going to let her know what’s going on.”

  In a blink, she’s gone, and I’m following Leon around the side of my house. His profile catches in the sun, and I wonder how he’s not sweating at all. He’s got these high cheekbones and bright eyes, where he could smile without even moving his lips.

  “I’m Cal,” I say. “I know we did this already, but I think we need a do-over. Because that was … weird.”

  “Leon.” He leads me down a grassy slope and to a path lined with trees. It’s not like the old woods you see in the parks in New York, but it’s equally manicured.

  We follow the path until we come to a little swing set. He veers off and jumps into a swing, immediately kicking off and soaring high. I sit in the other and rock back and forth slowly.

  “Your mom kind of saved me from the reporters.” I kick some of the dirt beneath my shoes. “It’s a lot to handle.”

  “I get that. People are obsessed with us now. It’s like StarWatch makes our lives seem so dramatic—well, our parents’ lives. They usually stay out of our way.”

  I chuckle. “Maybe that’s why they didn’t seem so interested in my dad. I think his chances of getting on the first mission are low.”

  “Why do you say that?”

  “He was a pilot for Delta.”

  I say that, like I always do, but Leon just stares at me.

  “Is that so bad?” he asks.

  “It’s not bad, it’s just … everyone here is so cool. My dad’s smart, sure, but he only knows how to fly a plane.”

  He laughs and slaps at the chains above my seat. I twist back and forth.

  “Only knows how to fly a plane. So, I’m guessing it takes a lot to impress you?”

  I pause, because even though I’m having a good time, I want to ask him if he really does buy into all this. The veneer cracked a bit when he laughed and when he kicked up on the swing set, but … the covers, the interviews, the relocation, the decor. How can he just be okay with it, when I’m all scrambled up?

  Or maybe I’m all scrambled up because I might be okay with it too.

  “There you guys are.” Katherine bounds toward us and sticks out her hand. “Okay, wow, I’m Kat, and I watch your feed religiously.”

  I pull back, just slightly, then shake her hand.

  “That was creepy,” she says. “I mean, your show and the Cal Letter are the only ways I get my news. I started watching when you covered the election, because you were the only news-ish person who didn’t make me want to punch them with their analysis.”

  “Oh, thank you. I don’t … think anyone’s ever said something so nice,” I say with a smirk.

  She shakes her head. “I swear, I’ll stop fangirling soon. Just. Seriously, you’re great. Your interview with the woman who developed FlashFame was my favorite, by far. I wanted to be her.”

  I twist my swing and my gaze meets Leon’s. “No raving compliments from you?” I smirk, and he busts out laughing.

  “You caught me—see, I’m the opposite. I just can’t stand your political analysis or whatever.” He rolls his eyes. “Joking. I’ve seen your videos, but only over Kat’s shoulder.”

  “Hmm, no feedback,” I say. “You’re not very helpful.”

  Katherine leans in, reducing her voice to a whisper. “The only feedback I ever hear is that he thinks you’re super cute.”

  I pull back and almost fall out of my swing, while Leon makes a guttural gasp that makes Katherine jump back in laughter. His composure’s shattered, and I bet he’d flip if the cameras were on him now.

  “Kat, what the hell?”

  She smiles broadly at this. “So you have two fans, is what I’m trying to say.”

  “This is a lot of information,” I say. I look between the two of them, and Katherine starts walking backward, away from our house.

  “Anyway, the reporters should be giving up soon now that StarWatch has got a grip on the situation,” Katherine says. “There’s a party Friday night, at our place, and Mom is going to invite your parents. You should come, if they even give you a choice in the matter. You’ll meet some of the other astronauts, and once you get incredibly bored of the science talk, you can find us at the back of the house with a bottle of champagne we’ve lifted from the stock.”

  “Kat!” Leon snaps.

  I nearly gasp—the prim, poised, and always proper Tucker kids. I imagine them in a backyard, sneaking out a bottle of champagne and staring into the sky. It reminds me of summer nights with Deb on the fire escape, with whatever we could lift from our parents’ alcohol stock—usually craft beers (meh), red wine (double meh), or scotch (quadruple meh, but wow it works fast).

  “Oh, calm down—Cal’s cool!” Kat does a quick, excited jump as she clasps her hands together. “These parties get boring fast without any other teens around. The astronauts all have young kids. We only come because, well, we live there.”

  I imagine how annoying it would be to be stuck around a bunch of drunk adults.

  “I can see why you would turn to champagne to fix your boredom,” I say with a laugh.

  “Oh, please,” she replies, “we end up pouring half of it out.”

  “Your mom won’t notice a bottle missing?” I ask.

  They both pause to consider me, and by the smirk on my face, they must be able to tell that I’m far more entertained by than appalled by their champagne heist.

  “You’ll understand when you get to the party,” Leon replies. I stand and dust myself off. I think about her words and sneak a glance at Leon before he can look at me. I think he’s cute too. Really cute. “See you soon, I hope?”

  His gaze meets mine, and an ache pulls at my chest, reminding me of Jeremy, of Deb. Of crushes, and of falling.

  Shooting Stars

  Season 2; Episode 6

  EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Our producers meet Calvin Lewis Sr., the final astronaut picked for the Orpheus missions. He takes a break from unpacking and starting a new life in Clear Lake, Texas, and joins astronaut Grace Tucker to chat with us about the space program, Calvin’s chances of making it to Mars, and the announcement that took us all by surprise. (New episode airs 6/10/2020)

  “Welcome to a new, and exciting—albeit rushed—Shooting Stars interview. I’m your host, Josh Farrow, and I am enthused to be bringing an exclusive interview to you with the final astronaut chosen for the Orpheus missions. And here he is: Calvin Lewis, along with a soon-to-be close colleague, Grace Tucker. Welcome to Clear Lake, Calvin.”

  “Well, um, thank you! Hope you don’t mind the boxes; we kind of just got here a couple hours ago.”

  “I assure you our viewers are not bothered by that. They’re interested in Calvin Lewis—Calvin Lewis Sr., I should say. Many of our viewers, of course, know all about Cal Junior. I must say, we were taken aback by his surprise announcement today.”

  “I think we were all a little caught off guard by that

. Look, we’re really sorry about—”

  “We’re so happy to have Calvin on board at NASA. I know how hard it was for my family to adjust—pulling Kat and Leon out of school, Tony’s job transition. We want to make sure they have a smooth, conflict-free transition, don’t you agree, Josh?”

  “Right, of course. Now, I’ll be honest with you, I usually go into these interviews much more prepared, but I’ve barely had time to review the press packet. So why don’t you talk to us about your experience. I see you most recently worked as a commercial pilot with Delta, is that right?”

  “Yes, I flew for Delta for about a decade, but I started in the air force—that’s where I met my lovely wife, Becca. She was working in cybersecurity, so our jobs never overlapped. But we happened to cross paths, and, you know, sparks flew.”

  “Fascinating. You know what I love most about interviews? It’s digging in and finding all the fascinating pieces of a person the world doesn’t get to see. And hopefully we’ll see that side later, but I am curious … what do you think your specialization is here? What do you bring here that no one else does?”

  “Oh, wow. That’s a big question. I feel like I’m in the job interview again, only there’s literally a spotlight on me now. Hah.”

  “Josh? If you don’t mind, I wanted to cut in.”

  “Of course, Grace. Go ahead.”

  “We were just discussing our experience, and I have to tell you—he’s genuinely knowledgeable and passionate about NASA, and I can’t wait to have him in flight simulations with us. During his time at Delta, he trained more pilots there than anyone else in the entire company. You know when you meet someone and automatically know they’ll go above and beyond to reach any goal? I haven’t seen that kind of determination around here since I met Mark Bannon! But there’s a personal connection too. Calvin, why don’t you tell them about when you first discovered you wanted to be an astronaut?”

  “Oh, sure. It’s a simple story, really. When I was ten or so, I watched this documentary on Apollo 11. Everyone knows Neil Armstrong, and we all know the glory those astronauts received, but I remember thinking of how innovative we must have been. They said the RAM, the memory, for the guidance computer matched that of a digital watch—and that was back in the early nineties, way before smart watches. I looked down at my own watch, which could barely do anything but blink and beep at me. And it hit me that … somewhere at the intersection of sheer human intelligence and determination—and a little bullheaded bravery—we made it to the moon. I can’t think of anything more inspiring. Nothing gives me more faith in humanity than seeing something like this come together. So, yes, I bring a lifetime of experience and enthusiasm, but I also bring a deep appreciation of the history and tenacity that made NASA what it is today.”''',

      'The Gravity of Us',
      '''Dad mutes the television.

  “So as you see, you missed a great interview.”

  It’s sarcasm. And I deserve it. We watch the show in its entirety, which starts out with a surprisingly in-depth look at all the new astronauts who have been brought on. The final astronaut, my dad, was barely covered.

  “They didn’t talk about you much, but that’s probably because they knew you had that interview with Grace,” Mom offers.

  He laughs. “I enjoy your optimism, but it’s pretty clear that Josh guy hates me. He said, maybe, three words to me?”

  “He said way more than that, Calvin.” She pauses to massage her temples. “Cal, he came in pretty quickly after you left with the Tucker kids. He was clearly pissed, but he thawed as soon as your dad told that story. Your dad’s got a little bit of that charm left in him.”

  Mom flicks Dad’s ear playfully.

  “Ew, guys. And I’ve told you, I’m sorry. I was just tired and grumpy. I didn’t think about what would happen. And really? Screw Josh Farrow. He just tried to make you look like a fool on camera, and you knocked that question out of the park.”

  “Thankfully Grace was there to lob me that softball of a question,” Dad says. “She was actually very nice to us, don’t you think?”

  Mom sighs, kind of wistfully. “I don’t know how she does it. As soon as you left, she snapped into media-training mode. She taught us so much in so little time. Thank god they didn’t want to see me, though. I was a mess.”

  “They will someday.” My voice is soft, but it still sucks the joy out of the room. “They’re going to be everywhere we go for the foreseeable future. Every public event. Every party. Was Josh Farrow really that angry?”

  “He was,” Dad says. “About time someone wiped that smug look off his face.”

  It breaks the tension in the room, momentarily, even though we know we’re not out of the woods yet. It’s day one, and we’ve already angered the wrong people. But for once, our family is gelling, and maybe that’s because we’re in this together. We don’t have any distractions—my only real friend is thousands of miles away, and I still haven’t unpacked my things, so I can’t even escape into my cassette collection.

  As I go to my empty room, I feel oddly free. The coils of tension in my back have snapped, my breaths are stronger, deeper. I slide under the sheets and squeeze my blanket. The heaviness of the day finally starts to set in as I plug in my phone.

  But just before I set my phone down, I see a new email in my “professional” inbox—the one I keep public so my fans and haters don’t clog up my personal email. One look at the subject line, and all the anxiety sucks back up into me, pulling my muscles taut and pushing an ache through my nervous system.

  StarWatch Media LLC: Letter of Cease & Desist for Calvin Lewis Jr.

  “Fuck,” I announce to the empty room.

  “I’m getting sued,” I tell Deb approximately two milliseconds after she answers the phone. “I’m getting sued!”

  “It’s seven thirty. In the morning.” She’s panting. “What is wrong with you? I closed last night.”

  “Oh, you closed a Paper Source in Park Slope? When? At, like, eight thirty?”

  “Nine, but I’m still tired. Damn.”

  There’s a pause on the line, and it hits me that just because I’ve been up half the night panicking and rereading the email I got doesn’t mean seven a.m. phone calls are appropriate. But I’m getting sued!

  “Elaborate. Please.” Deb still sounds mildly irritated, but she’s decided to put up with me, and I love her for it.

  “I got an email from StarWatch’s lawyers last night. I’ll spare you the legalese, but it basically means if I make another video, they’re going to pursue legal action. Their lawyer has an official letterhead and everything!”

  She sighs. “So, you’re not getting sued.”

  “Well, not yet, but—”

  “You aren’t being sued. You’re being threatened. Just lie low for a bit and have your parents look it over. Maybe they won’t even sue—I mean, that wouldn’t look good, would it? A big media company picking on a teen FlashFamer like that?”

  I consider her appeal. It makes sense, but how can I risk that? And the cease-and-desist letter was so broad as to include ANY video with me in it, regardless of location. In one minute, my career just vanished before my eyes.

  “I can’t risk streaming anything now. I knew they were pissed, but I didn’t think they’d do something like this. I’ve got all this nervous energy now, and I can’t sleep, and I don’t know what to do.”

  “Take a run?”

  We both laugh.

  “No, seriously,” I say, still chuckling at the prospect of physical activity, especially in this heat wave.

  “I don’t know. But I wouldn’t panic. You just got on their radar, and they want to scare you away. And Calvin?”

  “Yes?”

  “Never call me this early. Ever again.”

  I sigh. “Understood.”

  After I hang up, I pull up the map on my phone. There’s not much around me, and I don’t feel like exploring the city with our junker of a car today. I’m stuck with only one option—the Starbucks hal

f a mile away.

  So I put on a deep-cut tank, mesh shorts, running shoes, and sunglasses. It’s a quick athleisure look, and it’ll have to do. I step outside, and the refreshing air of an early summer morning hits me. The humidity seems to have disappeared, dew’s still on the grass, and things feel better already.

  While I’m walking, I feel myself picking up the pace to match my “city walking” style, but here … there’s nowhere to be, I have all the time in the world, and best of all, there are no tourists who need to be shoved out of the way. Win/win/win.

  So I slow my pace and read through the email in my mind. The letterhead was fancy, but was it there just to look scary? And the verbiage they used to explain what rule I broke, it didn’t even apply to me. The only thing I signed was a release form saying that StarWatch could post any videos or photos taken of me—that was required of everyone.

  “Hiya, friend!” someone shouts from the other side of the street. “Welcome to the neighborhood.”

  It’s Stephanie Jonasson, another of the candidates for the Orpheus V mission. I can’t remember what she does, but I know it has nothing to do with the actual navigation, so she’s not in the same field as Dad and Grace are.

  “Hi, Stephanie, right?”

  “Yep. And this is Tag,” she says, pointing down to her miniature Pomeranian, who is currently pawing my leg. “Say hi to Cal, Tag.”

  I bend down to pet the tiny dog. “Oh, right. I’ve seen Tag before—they did that Animal Planet documentary on him, right?”

  “Oh boy, you’ve got a fan!” she says to Tag.

  It’s weird when people talk to their dogs as if they’re humans, but I don’t say anything. The documentary comes back to me—it was a miniseries on famous pets, and an abnormally large amount of time was spent on Tag the Pomeranian.

  “Can I ask you … did StarWatch have any problems with the documentary? I know Animal Planet filmed on your property.”
  She laughs. “They have a problem with everything. But yes, I was forbidden from appearing in the documentary, my voice or face. They have a strict policy with the astronauts.”

  “With just the astronauts? I thought the families couldn’t join either.”

  “Well, they still threw a fit, but my wife Heather’s a lawyer. She pushed back until they eventually gave up, which is why she got to be in the documentary with our little boy here.” She pauses, and I see understanding dawn on her face. “Oh, let me guess, they’re not too happy about your announcement? I watched Shooting Stars last night and almost died when that jerk tried to show your dad up. But I was in tears by the end of it—I really can’t wait to meet your dad. He seems like a genuine guy.”

  “He is.” I smile, and the smile lingers for a bit as I bend down to give Tag a few more scratches.

  “StarWatch is, let’s say … a necessary evil. They make us look good, and they bring a lot of interest into the program. It’s easier to get projects funded by the government when a subset of the country passionately cares.” She laughs. “I mean, sure, I wish America cared for better reasons, but I won’t complain. Don’t worry too much about StarWatch. Their bark is worse than their bite.”

  We part ways, and I’m still a little terrified, but there’s this energy pulsing through my veins. It’s the same one I felt earlier as I leaned against the dresser. Rebellion. If it worked with Heather Jonasson, it’d work for me. It will work for me.

  At least, I hope it will.

  With a surge of inner strength, I pull out my phone and open the FlashFame app. Sure, no one else is going to be up now, but I have to document this so people can watch it later. As I look into the front-facing camera, a confident grin hits my face.

  “Good morning! If you aren’t already subscribed to the Cal Letter, you’re going to want to fix that now, because tonight I’m going to send you the full text of my cease-and-desist letter from StarWatch. Yeah, that’s right. StarWatch is threatening to sue me, of all people, but unfortunately for them, I didn’t sign any nondisclosure agreement.” I shake my head. “This mission’s screwed up my life enough as it is, and I’m not going to let a jerk with fancy letterhead keep me from sharing the truth with you. Keep an eye out for more updates soon, and if you’re in the mood for passive-aggressive statements about me, I’d keep your television set to the StarWatch network—they don’t take ‘no’ very well.”''',

      'The Gravity of Us',
      ''' While I’m no stranger to mild fame, I’ve never seen myself on the news doing something as innocuous as getting Starbucks or shopping at The Container Store. The Container Store!

  Only a handful of days have passed since I called out StarWatch, and since then, it’s like a target’s on my back. My daily Starbucks runs have been documented everywhere from Houston’s eleven p.m. news to Teen Vogue, and every site has their own version of the “drama” my rebellion has brought to Clear Lake.

  The real drama’s that every pic they snap shows me in a daze, with my hair eight kinds of fucked up. It’s not a good look for me. Sure, I’m being vain, but I’ve got a brand to protect.

  An equally bad look for me? Bright yellow gloves, dirt-stained jeans, and sweat dripping off my face. The hand shovel in my grip shrieks with strain every time I shove it into the ground, and I don’t blame it.

  This is not my idea of a great Wednesday.

  Kat walks toward my section of the community garden, and I guess she admires my work by the way she stares at it.

  “Is this the pepper patch?” She kneels to get to my eye level, then jumps back. “Are … you okay? You look like you’re struggling.”

  I wipe sweat off my brow with an equally sweaty forearm. “Gardening isn’t my favorite activity.”

  “Oh, I see that.” She fails to stifle a laugh. “If it makes you feel better, Mrs. Bannon has Leon checking the melon leaves for fungus or something.”

  I plant another pepper seedling—a tiny, insignificant little patch of leaves—and try to knock the dirt off my gloves by clapping. It doesn’t work.

  “Leon’s here?” I ask, trying to sound three parts nonchalant and one part eager. I think it comes out the other way. “I wanted to thank him—well, you both—again for stepping in and sneaking me away from the reporters last week.”

  “Don’t worry about it. And, yeah, I’ll show you where he is.” Kat pats the dirt around the last seedling I planted. She looks down the line of tiny leaves, hesitating, before taking my shovel. “Once we fix this. Sorry, these plants are too close. At least, based on what Mrs. Bannon told me when she asked me to come check on you.”

  “Not a chance. I followed instructions exactly,” I say. Kat’s gaze presses into me, and I give in. “Okay, there’s a small chance I wasn’t listening to all the details.”

  “It’s fine, I’ll just take out every other one and plant it farther down the line.” She looks to me for confirmation, but I just shrug. “Sorry, I’ve been taking this online coding class, and I think it’s spilling into my real life. Like I’m troubleshooting your gardening mishaps or something.”

  Laughing, I dig in with my hands and help Kat fix my mistake, while also trying not to damage any of the seedlings.

  “I didn’t know you code,” I say. “I don’t know why I would have known that, but still. My mom’s a developer. If you need any help, I’m sure she’d be up for it.”

  “Oh, I will definitely talk to her about it. Mom and Dad are no help when it comes to this stuff. I’ve been trying to start slow, but I have all these projects I want to try out. I write down ideas when they come to me … just have to wait until I’m actually good enough to code them.”

  The heat is sweltering, but a few clouds have gone by. Between that and conversing with someone who’s not barking instructions at me, I’m a little less crabby.

  A little.

  “So, do you do this often?” I ask, gesturing to the infant peppers. “Dad never told me volunteering at the community garden was a big thing for the astronaut families.”

  “Yeah, they don’t tell you about that when you sign up,” she says with a laugh. “But I think it’s great. Really. I mean, the parsnips I planted a few months ago should be ready to harvest at any time now, and that’s”—she hesitates—“not … even a good vegetable. Damn, you’re right, this sucks.”

  “I’m going to take a break,” I say. “If anyone asks, say I’m confirming the proper seedling spacing or something—it’ll buy me ten minutes at least. I just need a breather.”

  If she’s figured out I want to also stumble upon Leon’s fungus search—which sounds gross, but I’m sure he could even make fungus look cute—she doesn’t let on about it.

  “A break sounds good. I might go look for your mom. I’m really curious what coding languages she uses,” she says before we part.

  The park is expansive by Clear Lake standards—at least the length of a couple of football fields. Apparently, they rent out small patches for personal use, and the crops from the bigger gardens go to the community food bank.

  I come up to a sprawling patch of vines, and my gaze falls across the guy who’s closely inspecting each leaf. Leon. My heart does an extra pound for good measure, as if I wasn’t already aware of my feelings.

  When I get to him, I give my mouth the command to speak, but nothing comes out. I’m just standing there, with the smile on my face growing by the second, like a creep. When he looks up at me, all disheveled and covered in dirt, I doubt I’ll ever be able to speak again.

  Thankfully, I find the words.

  “How’s the fungus?”

  They’re not the best words, but they’re words nonetheless. My cheeks flush with heat.

  “No sign of it yet,” he says, “but Mara is having me check again. She thinks the ‘cold spell’ last week brought the soil temperatures down.”

  “Cold spell?” My laugh is too loud, too awkward. “What’d you get down to—seventy?”

  “Seventy-five, maybe?”



  Leon stands, and for a second, we just smile at each other. There’s a peace in being alone with him, even when we’re not saying much. The nuanced expressions, the rising pulse rate, all bring a rush, a high all over my body.

  But the line between sweet and creepy is especially thin when crushes are concerned, and there’s only so long two people can stand in silence before it gets weird.

  “You look nice,” I say.

  “… How is that possible?”

  “I don’t know. Dirt suits you? I have a thing for gardeners?” I pause. “I’m awful at this.”

  “You’re fine.” With a soft quirk of a smile, he points to a shaded spot under a tree, and we take seats in the grass as he pulls out a water bottle. He offers it to me, and I take a sip of the cool water. But it doesn’t cool me off. It doesn’t calm me down.

  “We didn’t really get to talk earlier,” he says. “It’s kind of weird getting to know someone who you only know vaguely from the internet. I mean, my sister probably knows every detail about you.”

  “Eh,” I grunt, “she only knows a specific part of me. I give my personal updates sometimes, but I really care about my reporting. Either way, the guy on the screen is just … a version of me. The version I want people to see. A brand, almost.”

  I want him to see all of me.

  “That’s got to be hard,” he says.

  “It’s hard to always be on. I always feel pressured to have the cheekiest take on an issue, or to know every cool thing happening in the city. It’s a lot of work to keep this up, and I think, because it’s ‘just social media,’ people don’t see that.”

  He starts to reply, but I’m distracted by the vibration in my pocket. When I pull the phone out, I gasp. “Shit.”

  “What is it?” Leon asks. “Everything okay?”

  “I … I had an internship for BuzzFeed—to cover local events in New York and boost their video content. It was going to be my first real chance to break into the business. Do something close to what I really want to do.”

  “It … was?”

  “Obviously, coming to Texas wasn’t in my plan at that point. My friend Deb convinced me to email them to see if they’d consider a remote internship or some other collaboration. I was desperate, so I did, and … now I’m too scared to read the response.”

  He inches closer to me, and the place where his arm meets mine shoots electric currents through my body. As he leans closer, I smell the comforting aroma of earth and spice. Whether it’s his deodorant or cologne cutting through the smell of the park, I don’t know. What I do know is, I’m so caught up in the scent, my heart is struggling to keep the blood pumping through my body right now.

  “Come on, read it. What’d they say?” he asks, his voice an excited whisper.

  I clench my phone, still holding it facedown. I am not ready for this. Not here, not now. But with Leon next to me, I find the courage to turn over my phone and open the email.

  Hey Cal—I talked it over with my boss, and we definitely want to work on something in the future, but unfortunately—

  That’s all I allow myself to read. I stand up, wanting to duck out somewhere. But there’s nowhere to go. Cameras fill the exits, astronauts and their families prowl the gardens … this is as alone as I’m going to get.

  “I’m so sorry, Cal.” Leon pulls me toward him and puts an arm around me—just quick enough for his scent to fill my lungs, but not long enough for me to come to my senses and hug back.

  “It’s fine. It’s fine,” I say, even though it’s not fine. “I knew this would happen, I just didn’t expect it to sting so much.”

  “You’ll find something else.”

  “But this is what I wanted. This was my plan, my way in.”

  His hand slides down my arm, gently but deliberately, and I feel the support pouring out from him. “Then just come up with a new plan.”

  I laugh, because that’s one thousand times easier said than done. After a few breaths, I start to believe it, though. There are other ways—I just have to figure them out. This is a minor setback. I suck in a breath and hold it in my chest, steeling my core.

  “I’m still really bummed,” I say, releasing the breath, along with my confidence.

  He places an arm on my back and leads me back toward the gardens. We have been gone for a while, and they’re bound to notice if we don’t come back soon. Plus, they seem to be setting up a stage for an impromptu press conference.

  Leon clears his throat, dropping his palm from my back. “Can I ask you something?”

  “What do you want to know?” I ask. “I’m an open book. Kind of.”

  He laughs and scrunches his eyebrows to look like he’s deep in thought. “So … is that why you do it? The app and the fame?”

  “I want to be a reporter.” He just keeps his eyes on me, and the words fall out. “But it’s more than that. I am a reporter now, however amateur it might seem. I want to make a name for myself. I want the mainstream media to know that this new form of reporting matters, and that it can make a difference.”

  “Those sound like good reasons.”

  “I guess I just like telling a story. I like challenging people’s thoughts, starting conversations. And, I don’t know … I kind of like when people listen.”

  “Wow … it must feel good to know exactly what you want.” He rubs his shoulder in an awkward, almost self-conscious fashion. “That’s got to be validating, though. It’s like you have all this power. People really care. They listen to you.”

  He won’t make eye contact with me now, and I see the boy in the magazine photo again with his distant stare, his sullen expression. I wonder what I did, or what I said, to make this version of him come out. I want to make him feel better, but I don’t know what he needs.

  I reach out to him, but a shrill screech comes from the amps that circle the rickety stage set up in the center of the park. Our attentions shift. Unresolved tension balls in my chest.

  The moment’s passed.

  After a quick sound check, and a few posed shots for the local news photographers, astronaut behemoth Mark Bannon approaches the stage. At the podium, five or six microphones intertwine, and I assume that’s because one is hooked up to the amps around the stage and the rest go to all the local feeds or StarWatch.

  “Speaking of damning emails … have you heard anything else from StarWatch’s lawyers?” Leon asks. “I, uh, noticed you didn’t cease … or desist.”

  I chuckle as we both sit cross-legged on the ground. “Nothing yet.”

  “Are you nervous, though?” Leon’s hand reaches out for my elbow for a second, but he pulls it back. Even in this heat, my arm hairs prickle at the phantom sensation. “I would be. StarWatch is … well, they have a grip on us in a way that not even the bigger players like CNN or the New York Times do.”

  “A grip?” My voice is thin, the bravado vanishing by the second.

  Mark Bannon’s amplified voice breaks through our conversation.

  “Friends, thank you for being here. And a special thank-you to Mara Bannon, my perfect wife, who somehow has the patience and the energy to coordinate these volunteer days.”

  There’s a chuckle, followed by applause.

  Mark clears his throat. “This is a great week for NASA. After five years of searching, the core team of astronauts for the Orpheus project has been assembled. We’re finally a complete unit. Now, we still don’t know the first six to be scheduled on Orpheus V”—he winks to a camera to his right—“which I know is dirt my friends at StarWatch have been especially eager to uncover. But what we do know is this: in twelve months, six of us are going up into space, and we’re not coming back until we touch Martian soil.”

  Leon scoots closer to me on the ground and nudges me with his elbow. “Get ready—Bannon’s a bit of an … idealist.”

  “As we approach, oh, T-minus thirty-one-million seconds until liftoff, it’s worth thinking about why we’re here. Why we’re doing this. Why should you”—the way he say

s “you” makes you feel like he’s talking directly to you, to all Americans, and all humanity at the same time—“care?”

  Another dramatic pause, and I think I hear Leon snickering beside me.

  “Progress. It’s another giant leap, yes, but it’s more than that—it’s about developments in solar energy, medical technology, climate research. Getting humans to Mars to set up the Orpheus Martian Base is the first step to unlocking all these secrets. When we land—I promise you’ll all remember where you are on that day for the rest of your lives.”

  More applause as he gets off the stage, and Mara nearly tackles him as a greeting. I look to Leon, and he’s more expressive than I’ve ever seen him: rolling his eyes, an incredulous look on his face.

  Kat returns and sits next to me. “He really knows how to hype up a crowd.”

  “It’s all nonsense,” Leon says.

  I stay quiet. Truth is, I felt Mark’s passion through his speech. My heart’s pounding in my chest, and I get that rush. I get the way he tells this story.

  Off the podium, Mark and Mara speak to the local news, who can’t get enough of the action. When the Bannons hold hands, even I get the urge to go interview them and join the media frenzy.

  “I don’t know,” I say. “I think Mark really believes what he says.”

  They stay silent, probably because they moved on to another topic while I spaced out. When the Bannons tire of the interview and take their leave, the cameras fan out to get some shots of the other families.

  A photographer breaks off to get some candid shots of Mom and Dad at one of the gardens. Leon grabs my shoulder, hard, and I nearly jump—but when I see a StarWatch producer and cameraman hustling toward us, I get why.

  We stand and dust ourselves off as the producer gives orders to the cameraman to hold off on recording for a few minutes. She turns to me.

  “You’re the one with the social media or whatever, right?”

  “I … guess so?”

  She looks so uninterested, I can’t tell if she’s happy, sad, or has the capacity to feel human emotion at all.

“I’m Kiara. I’m from Brooklyn too.”

  She doesn’t ask for my name, but I guess that’s because she knows it, or she doesn’t care. Even with her attitude, there’s a part of her that comforts me. She’s cute and familiar. Like, Brooklyn cute, which makes sense.

  She’s got ankle boots and tight black jeans. She’s got a mostly see-through white blouse on with a plaid shirt overtop. Her unnaturally black hair falls down past her shoulders, and she looks out at me from behind bug-eyed reflective shades. Somehow, she pulls off the look and stays sweat-free.

  And I can tell her attitude isn’t directed at me, or anyone for that matter. She just seems … over it. Which I have to admit is also a comforting emotion, given how expressive all these Texans are.

  “These events are just the worst, aren’t they?” she asks.

  “It’s my first event,” I say with a shrug. “But hopefully I’ll be conveniently sick for the next one.”

  Leon snorts, but says nothing. She chuckles too, and the snarky Brooklyn chord that still strums within me resonates with hers.

  Kat moves closer to us just as the camera starts rolling, and the three of us pose awkwardly in front of the camera. After a heavy breath, Kiara’s personality flips. She’s on. She’s smiling, engaged—I’m drowning in her passion.

  “I’m here with all three teens of the Orpheus astronauts, and fast friends since day one: Cal Lewis Jr. and Leon and Katherine Tucker. So, what did you think of that speech?” Kiara asks. “Pretty amazing, huh?” We hesitate. Her eyes narrow, and I see the real Kiara flash behind them.

  “Oh, yeah,” I say quickly. “Listening to Mark will always get you inspired.”

  “That’s so true,” she replies. “Do we have any budding astronauts in this group?”

  She smiles and tilts her head like we’re puppies, which definitely isn’t condescending or enraging at all—I have to physically strain to hide my disgust on camera.

  But even I can’t form words. I know these interviews are fake; they’re expertly cut to fit whatever narrative they find most entertaining. I’ve seen it happen so many times, but to watch StarWatch do it in person to me? That’s when I start to feel icky.

  Thankfully, Kat saves the day. She launches into a seemingly prepared response about how she can see herself becoming one of NASA’s programmers someday, but would never go up on a spaceship.

  She smiles. She giggles. The camera eats it up.

  “And Leon, we assume you’re not following in your mother’s footsteps. Everyone’s wondering when we’ll learn more about your gymnastics career. Do you think you’ll steal the spotlight from your mom and make it on the US Olympic Gymnastics Team?”

  “I, um, think that’s a bit of a stretch.” Leon’s posture’s changed; he seems unenthused to the point of exhaustion.

  “That’s a good point. Can’t get cocky yet! You’ve got a long road ahead, and we’re so glad there might just be a whole family of American heroes here. And you—”

  The camera points to me, and I hesitate.

  Kat’s all in. Leon’s all out.

  And I’m somewhere in the in-between.''',

      'The Gravity of Us',
      '''In the past few hours, I’ve listened through four of my cassettes, changed into three different outfits, and ignored two heated arguments (Dad unpacked all the kitchen boxes; Mom can’t find anything) all to prep for one party. But it’s an important one. It’s our welcome party.

  However, I can’t find an outfit to save my life, because Leon texted “excited to see you tonight :)” and my body melted into a puddle on the floor, and now I can’t even button up a shirt right because my entire body is tingly.

  I tear through my closet, knowing nothing I own will impress him.

  I pull out my phone, without much thinking, and dial Deb. If anyone can calm me down, it’ll be her.

  “Astrokid, what’s happening?”

  I scoff, and consider hanging up on her to prove a point, but I say, “Shut it. I need your help. Wait, maybe this will work. Or does it look like I’m trying too hard?”

  “Do you want me to stay on the line or …?”

  “Yes, hold on, sorry.”

  The outfit I’ve settled on is simple. Well, it’s one of those that isn’t really simple, but looks effortless. Black jeans over worn boots. A light jean jacket over a tan-and-gray-plaid shirt, over a black tee. Each time I look in the full-length mirror, I feel self-doubt gnaw at me in a way I don’t usually experience. Is this right? Is this too Brooklyn? I already ditched the John Mayer hat and infinity scarf—because let’s be honest, Clear Lake ain’t ready for that.

  “Sure, okay, whatever, let me drop everything,” she says.

  “What could you possibly be doing right now?”

  The silence on the other end is palpable, and I realize I’m being pretty rude. I’ve always thought of Deb as mine, as in, you never had to make plans with her because she was always free (and vice versa).

  “Okay, I’m being rude but I’m also freaked. We have our first party tonight. Like, with all the astronauts. StarWatch will be there.”

  “Have they said anything about the cease and desist?” she asks.

  “Not yet,” I say. “But I know they will soon. My videos have been getting a lot of traction lately.”

  “Yeah, I’ve already seen you on the news twice since you moved. This has been an eventful week.”

  “Exactly. Plus, I’m doubly freaking out because Leon Tucker said I was cute, and I also think he is cute, and it’s not like I can run to my parents and talk about this because, as you can probably hear, they are always shouting about something.”

  “If you really wanted me just to say everything’s going to be fine and you’ll be great, we could have done this over text.”

  Her voice is bitter, and it reminds me of the few times we passed each other in the stairwell or saw each other in school after I broke up with her. But just as our relationship was inevitable—she was the literal girl next door, with the wit and charm to make anyone want to be around her—so too was the rebirth of our friendship.

  Our dating relationship was easy, until it wasn’t, for me at least. But our friendship always seemed to transcend our petty fights or obnoxious habits.

  “I’m … sorry?” I say.

  A sigh from the other end. “Fine, sorry. Guess it was my turn to be an ass. I just have a feeling this is going to be one of those catch-up sessions where you talk the whole time and then say ‘I gotta go’ and dash when I have things to tell you too.”

  “That’s not true,” I say before glancing at the clock. “Shit, well …”

  “You actually do have to go, don’t you?”

  “The party started five minutes ago. I just don’t know how fashionably late we’re going to be.” I clear my throat. “I’ll call you later, okay? Maybe not tonight, but soon.”

  “Fine, fine.” A beat. “And Cal?”

  “Yeah?”

  “Everything’s going to be fine and you’ll be great. You can text me a picture of your outfit if you want me to approve it, which I will, immediately. Just call me later, okay?”

  “Okay. Thanks.” I take a long breath and let it hiss out of my teeth.

  “Love you,” she says.

  “I know.”

  We drive up to the party at eight fifteen, though if the party is as champagne-fueled as I’ve been led to believe, we will be walking back.

  I pause inside the doorway, and my eyes widen at the sight. The walls are all wood with teal and gold details. The glassware is out, dozens of champagne glasses—bright, sparkling ones like the expensive crystal flutes my parents bring out every year on their anniversary. Copper serving trays are being passed around, with deviled eggs and other more questionable meat appetizers.

  To the side, taking up an entire kitchen island, are the bottles of champagne sitting in a copper tub full of ice. Leon and Kat were right: no one would notice a bottle—or ten—missing from this supply.

  E

veryone’s dressed up in their own interpretation of the term. From air force uniforms to sleek dresses, to bow ties and blazers over jeans. Glasses clink; the scent of vanilla candles fills the space between the tightly packed bodies.

  I navigate around the pockets of chatting astronauts, their families, and media types. I can’t discern the music that plays, but the strumming of a rhythmic guitar floods the room. It’s coming from all around—the record player’s hooked up to a surround sound speaker system. It’s a heavy-handed metaphor for the whole night, but it works.

  When I turn back, my dad comes through the door and freezes. “This is just like … oh my god.”

  Tears start forming in his eyes, but he rubs his eyes quickly to shrug it off. We’re all dazzled, but thankfully everyone’s huddled in the kitchen, and they haven’t really paid attention to us.

  “You remember those Life magazines I’ve showed you?” Dad asks. “With the astronaut parties with the families? This is it. It’s real.” He clears his throat as a tear rolls down his cheek. Mom puts a hand on his back.

  I’m feeling something here. Some bizarre nostalgia for an era that came half a century before my existence.

  It’s all beautiful. And overwhelming.

  Until I hear the whisper-yelled commands of someone to my right. “Closer,” the voice says. “Did you get the tear?”

  In the corner of the room, Kiara’s got her sights set on me and my dad, while Josh Farrow—“the face of Shooting Stars”—stands next to her with a clipboard, directing her every move.

  Dad doesn’t notice, but just being in the same room as StarWatch makes me uncomfortable, so I slip away as Mom introduces herself to the families who were lucky enough to get out of gardening duty. As I reach the kitchen, Kat runs up and gives me a big hug. I did not think we were hugging friends. Or, maybe hugs are just a Texas thing.

  She pulls out a Tupperware stocked with deviled eggs and starts placing them on the tray.

  “I made these, so you better like ’em.”

  “Why are they … green?”

  She laughs. “Fair question. I add avocado to them. It’s my secret ingredient, though I guess when it completely changes the color it’s not so secret.”

  “No, not exactly.”

  I take one anyway, thankful there’s at least one meatless thing I can eat here. I scan the crowd, and my chest aches as I look for Leon. This isn’t a totally new feeling for me. There were sparks with Deb once. And something with Jeremy too.

  But something about this feels different. Deb was my best friend, and we just fell into a comfortable relationship. Jeremy was new and exciting, and he was there as I took a self-guided tour of my own queerness—something I may never fully find the right label for.

  But with Leon, the burning in my chest has never been so perfectly bright. So clear. It’s like when I spend hours picking background colors for the teaser images before my shows—when I hit that perfect shade of bluish-green, and I could never describe why it’s perfect, but it just is.

  With my crush on Leon, it so clearly is right.

  Every time I close my eyes and let my mind drift for too long, I see his face giving that side-eye smirk with those perfect teeth. Those teeth that rarely see the camera—back at the swings, it felt like he’d stocked up all his smiles for me, for that moment.

  And something else—no, not his ridiculously sculpted gymnastics muscles—draws me to him. It’s the hesitant quality that the camera does get to see. The side I saw in the gardens. Everyone else here is so sure of themselves, so overconfident. But he’s different. Real.

  I’m jerked out of my daydreaming by a palm on my back. I turn to see a woman in a dark blue blazer, and I’m caught off guard by her intense body language. She’s too close for comfort, and now her hand’s outstretched, and I wonder if my face reflects my shock.

  “Donna Szleifer,” the woman says. “I’m NASA’s deputy social media manager, and this is Todd Collins, who directs our public affairs team.”

  She pulls another suit next to her, and the man in it smiles briefly.

  “Hi,” I say. Because I have no other words to say to these people right now. Because I should not be the one interacting with NASA staff. “I’m Cal.”

  “We were surprised to see that you broke the news,” Todd says.

  “But we shared your clip right away on Twitter and Facebook,” Donna says, “and tied it in with our press releases, and it’s gotten a lot of attention, which is great. Just great.”

  I reach behind my head and rub my neck, just to give my hands something to do. My cheeks grow warm, and my shoulders form into a shrug.

  “Yeah, look, I’m sorry abo—”

  “Calvin Lewis,” Dad cuts in, and appears beside me, and I sigh as I’m saved from a potentially awkward conversation.

  “Rebecca Lewis. But you can call me Becca,” my mother says and offers her hand. Her shyness is in full force, and she clutches her purse to her body as if someone here was going to snatch it from her. But she’s taking the lead in introducing herself. She’s putting herself out there. She’s really trying. Either that or she’s stocking up on stories to tell her therapist.

  Out the corner of my eye, I see Kat by the back door. It’s a sliding glass door that’s propped open, though no lights or anything seem to be on. She nods toward the door and widens her eyes to give me the hint.

  I slip out of the conversation, remembering the promise of champagne and time with Leon and Kat. Thankfully, it’s not too hard to go unnoticed.

  But then I feel a presence behind me, a mammoth one, and it sends chills all over my body. The kind of chills that spike at your neck and raise hairs you didn’t even know you had, then rush down your back in shuddered pulses.

  Craning my neck, I recognize the star of the astronauts’ volunteer day: Mark Bannon. Up close, it becomes even clearer that he is the tallest astronaut of all time.

  That’s not an exaggeration. It’s his claim to fame. He’s six foot five, the exact tallest an air force fighter pilot can be, way taller than astronauts used to be allowed to be. But the Orpheus capsules are bigger, and he has the room to exist there.

  His smile is huge, unmoving, like his face is made of stone. Actually, his whole body might be made of stone. I have a feeling that if I were to punch him in the gut, I’d be the one hurting.

  “Mark Bannon,” I say, as if he doesn’t know his own name. “Um, Mr. Bannon. I mean, Mr. Mark Bannon. I enjoyed your speech at the park.”

  “Just Mark is fine,” he says with a heavy laugh. “Thank you, thank you. You Calvin’s boy? I suspect we’ll all be getting to know each other quite well.”

  “I guess so. Maybe you’ll get to fly with my dad someday.”

  Mark laughs. “That’s not likely.”

  “What do you—”

  He holds up a hand. I obey his rock-palm and stop speaking. So much for my meaningless small talk.

  “You know how long I’ve been here, right?” he asks somewhat condescendingly, as if I’m supposed to do anything but agree with him.

  I do. He was one of the first.

  “But there are six spots.”

  “The role your dad would play in a mission—it’d mostly revolve around maneuvering the ship. Your dad’s a pilot, just like me and Mrs. Tucker. Only one of us will be picked for the mission. The other two will be alternates, so we’ll all be working the same drills, day in and day out.”

  “Oh, well, that’s nice,” I say. “Look, it was great meeting you, but I have to go find someone.”

  He lets me go after a firm (almost painful) handshake. Once I finally get outside, the music and the noise of the party all die down and I’m able to breathe, even despite the humidity.

  The moon’s glow lights the backyard, enough for me to see that there’s no one back here. I walk around the yard, taking in the brief respite, wondering when Kat and Leon will join me, when I hear a noise.

  “Cal!” someone says. I turn to find there’s a pathway to t

he side of the house that I hadn’t noticed before. Their yard is fenced in, which leaves a little nook for a few chairs, a bottle of champagne, and a small shed.

  I walk quickly over, nearly breaking into a run, and stop to smile when I see Leon. He smiles back and gestures to the seat next to him.

  “Good to see you,” I say. “Everyone else is fucking weird here.”

  “You’re including Kat in that?”

  “Your sister put avocado in the deviled eggs. She can’t be trusted.”

  He laughs at that. A soft laugh—more strained than light. The moon illuminates his features, and my brows furrow to match his.

  “Hey, you okay?”

  He makes eye contact with me, briefly. “Oh, hmm. Yeah. Sorry, I guess I just get antisocial at these things.”

  His sullen expression floods into my body, and I consider asking about it, but something stops me and tells me we’re not there yet.

  I don’t know where we are, but I like the journey so far.

  I take the unattended, opened champagne bottle on the ground and bring it to my lips. The tart, fizzy liquid burns my throat as I swallow it down. The taste isn’t great, but I could get used to it.

  “I like this little hidden area,” I say, which makes him laugh. “No, I’m serious! This was the size of my bedroom in Brooklyn. It’s comforting.”

  He looks dramatically from left to right. “This was your room?”

  “Well, it had a ceiling, but yes.”

  We pass the bottle, and the flavor gets better. The burning is less noticeable at least.

  “So, Houston,” I say. “Anything fun to do downtown? Shows or anything?”

  “We don’t get a ton of bands that play here. We’ll get stadium tours sometimes, but those are a little more mainstream—Elton John, Nicki Minaj, Justin Timberlake. People like that.” He smirks. “It’s probably not your scene.”

  “Excuse me? You think I don’t like mainstream music?” I don’t bring up my cassette collection.

  He shrugs. “You’ve got the Brooklyn hipster vibe, what can I say? You’re telling me you don’t go to indie shows?”

  “Well, I never said that. Back home Deb and I saw a ton of indie shows. But the reasons for that are twofold: First, it’s Brooklyn, so indie shows are everywhere. Second, those tickets are cheap. It’s not like either of us could afford to see shows at Madison Square Garden.”
  I take a swig from the bottle as he starts laughing again.

  “You think you know me so well,” I say, wiping the foam from my lips. “But let me guess—you haven’t been to a concert since you came here. Oh, wait, I know your type. You listen to the radio, because you like a lot of different music, but you don’t really stan for anyone.”

  “Wow, almost none of that was correct.” He pats my back condescendingly. “Really good try, though.”

  “Fine, who do you stan for?”

  “Dear god. I will tell you if you stop saying the word ‘stan.’ ” He keeps my gaze, and the reflection of the porch light makes his eyes shine. “I don’t have a favorite, but I literally couldn’t go to the gym for practice without my K-pop playlist.”

  I hesitate, and he must see the confusion in my face, because he follows it up quickly, tension straining his voice.

  “I mean, I like mainstream music like SZA and Khalid and whatever Calvin Harris song is currently at the top of the Billboard charts too.”

  “No, K-pop is cool, I just never pictured you a fan of it. I haven’t listened much, but I’ve watched a few music videos before. They are super entertaining.”

  He thaws a bit, and as I pass the champagne to him, I scoot a little closer. Almost imperceptible, but from this angle, our knees softly brush against each other. He doesn’t pull away, and the heat from his touch makes me melt.

  “The music’s great, and there are so many artists I love in the genre, but there’s just something about how every song is high tempo and exciting—K-pop knows how to hit hard. It kind of makes me feel invincible. And I don’t get hung up on lyrics since, well, I don’t know what they’re saying.”

  “Makes sense to me.” I offer him a genuine smile, and he returns it.

  My smile widens, and a laugh comes out.

  “What was that for?”

  “Just, you and I are different in so many ways, but …” I drift off, formulating my thought. “We’re kind of playing the same role. We have this massive public presence, but we’ve got this whole life that the public doesn’t see. I can’t believe you’re that stoic, almost regal cutie from the Time magazine cover.”

  He sighs, and a distant look takes over his expression.

  There are a dozen more questions I planned on asking him, about the astronaut families, about his mom, about Clear Lake. But there’s one that, maybe it’s seeing him with his guard down like this, that I need to ask.

  “Can I … be real with you for a second?” I hiss a long sigh through my teeth. “How do you all stay acting so perfect?”

  I see the skepticism behind his eyes, so I pull back.

  “Why do you ask?” he says. “This isn’t, like, for your show or anything, is it?”

  I avoid eye contact and feel the blood rush to my head. “No, no. Of course not. I just … my family is … I don’t know, it was an idiotic question, sorry.”

  He puts a hand on my knee, and I breathe in so fast it’s almost a gasp. It’s unfair that there are enough nerve endings stored in my knee to make a simple act like that leave me breathless.

  Our eyes meet, and suddenly I’m the insecure one.

  “My dad isn’t like yours,” I say. “My mom isn’t like yours. I’m not like you. We can’t carry ourselves like you do. We aren’t built to deal with this, no matter how much Dad thinks we are.”

  “Cal, we’re not perfect. We’re far from it.”

  “Come on, you are literally America’s family right now. You were on the cover of Time—all of you.”

  He shakes his head. “Don’t treat me like that, please. I see it in your eyes right now, this awe of my perfect life. It’s not perfect. We can pretend, I guess. I can pretend better than I thought, actually. Well, maybe not—near the end of that Time photoshoot the photographer made us all do a serious pose because he said my smile didn’t look ‘right’ in the other shots. I can fake a confident, serious pose, but I can’t fake happiness.”

  We’re close, but I want to lean in even closer. His melancholy buries itself into me, and I want to stop it. I focus on his face in the moonlight, and it’s then I realize I want to kiss him. I want to fix his insecurities and make it better, even if the happiness and rightness lasts only a couple of seconds. Or a few minutes. I bite my lips, subconsciously, and his gaze drops to them.

  But it’s too fast. Or is it? He can’t deny this connection, the one I know buzzes through both of us. The fire’s not strong, but something’s there, smoldering.

  I lean forward, just slightly.

  And he stops me.

  He puts a hand to my chest, and his eyes soften to almost a look of pity. My chest aches with awkwardness, and I want nothing more than to jump over this fence and never look back and—

  “I think you’re cute,” he says. “I know we just met, but there’s something about you I really like. But I need to make sure you understand something first.”

  I clear my throat and look past his ear. Anywhere that’s not his perfect eyes. “Oh, um. What’s that?”

  “If you want to kiss me, kiss me because you like me. Not because you think it’ll make me happy.”

  “But I—”

  “You can’t just kiss away all the bad feelings I have. You can’t kiss me and make me better. I think you know that, but … I have to say it.”

  There’s a part of me that wants to deny it. To say that I really just thought he was cute and super kissable and wanted to go for it—not that all those things aren’t true, but that’s not what made me lean in. I wanted to help. I wanted to kiss him and see him smile again.

  He doesn’t deserve that, which is why I say, “I’m sorry. You’re right.”

  “Thought so.” He sighs. “You had that ‘poor puppy’ look. It was cute, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t like being the one who makes you look like that. Like you think I’m some broken baby bird or something.”

  It’s silent for a bit. I wait for the awkwardness to set in, but as we pass the bottle back and forth, I feel myself worrying less about the silence and enjoying his company more. It’s a bit cooler out, and a nice breeze cuts through the humidity.

  “Sorry if I made things weird,” he says. “I’m not usually so upfront about my, um, depression.” His voice dips, low and soft, like it’s a foreign word he knows he’s pronouncing incorrectly. “It’s something I’ve been trying lately. I’m not always my strongest advocate, you know?”

  I nod. “For the record. I do want to kiss you, at some point. And not just to make you happy.”

  He smiles at that, and the tension in my shoulders melts away.

  “Someday,” he offers.

  “Yeah, someday.”

  I want to tell him I’m here, that he can talk to me if he needs to. Or I can sit here, inches from him, listening to him breathe. In, and out. I want him to know how remarkable it is that, of the billions of people in the world, I am the one who’s sitting next to him, under stars and the champagne’s haze. I want him to know the improbability of two people meeting like this. That it’s astounding, no matter how inconsequential it is. Sure, strangers meet all the time. It’s the universe’s way to say we don’t matter. None of this matters.

  Our eyes meet. And it’s clear that, sometimes, the universe is just wrong.

  I almost lean into him again, but I hear someone open the sliding glass door. It’s Kat, and she’s around the corner in a flash, taking up the third chair with a sigh.

  “You guys are missing a hell of a party. They’re all sucking down the champagne. Cal’s dad and Stephanie Jonasson—” she turns to me and adds, “the one who brings her yappy dog to parties—are currently battling for control of the record player.”

  “Good.” Leon laughs. “I hope they break it.”

  Kat turns to me. “So this record player came with the house, because everything has to be sixties and seventies themed, I guess, and Mom kept bringing home these records after work. She would bring like ten home a week. One day she comes in

with a big stack, and Dad is like, ‘Hey, what’s going on? Are you raiding a record store on your lunch break?’ First, she laughs because she doesn’t get much of a lunch break, being an astronaut and all, and then she says, ‘They just keep giving them to me. I can’t say no.’ ”

  “You mean NASA is buying your mom records?” I ask.

  “Dozens of them,” Leon explains. “They know Mom and Dad throw most of the parties here, and I think they think it sets the tone, or whatever. During one Shooting Stars episode they asked what Mom’s favorite record was. She got so flustered, it was great. I guess I get the retro appeal, but I don’t know why NASA won’t let them stream like normal people.”

  “Ha, right.” My voice cracks.

  “It’s total nonsense,” Kat says, then gasps. “Oh! Sorry, your cassette thing is totally different.”

  I look down, and heat flushes my face.

  “What?” Leon asks. “What did I say?”

  “I—it’s embarrassing.” I never thought it was embarrassing before, until I heard those words come out of his mouth. “I have a tape deck. A cassette player, I mean. I get a lot of old cassettes, and whatever new ones come out. I’ve got a big collection now. The sound’s smoother, I guess.”

  “We didn’t mean to make fun of you.” Kat laughs. “Well, we didn’t then. Now, I kind of do. How old is that cassette player I see in all your vids? Can I remind you that you were not alive in the eighties or nineties, and even if you were, you’d have no right collecting them?”

  “Ohhhhh,” Leon says. “It’s a Brooklyn hipster thing, isn’t it? So, I think that means I was right.”

  I laugh at that, and I slap at him to get him off my back.

  “What are you two talking about?” Kat asks.

  I roll my eyes as Leon launches into an explanation of our earlier conversation.

  “Oh, you told him about the K-pop—that’s usually info you drop during the second date.”

  Turning to her, I narrow my eyes.

  “Uhhh,” Leon says. “We’d need a first date for that to happen.”

  “Look, I’m just saying I ran interference for thirty whole minutes so you two could have some alone time. Champagne, the moon, the stars—all looks like first date material to me.”

  The way my heart is beating … this isn’t a date, it’s on a totally separate plane. Do you need a first date when you can hide from gardening duty together under a tree, or get to know each other under a perfect night sky?

  “Dating is overrated,” I say. “I like whatever we’re doing.”

  Kat squeals, which makes Leon groan. After a few more minutes, we’re able to polish off the rest of the bottle.

  “Oh, guess what? Cal’s mom said she’d start giving me some coding lessons,” Kat says while chucking the bottle in the recycling bin. “She’s awesome.”

  I laugh, knowing my mom would die with joy if she knew a teen honestly thought she was awesome.

  “That’s great,” Leon says. “But we should really get inside before they actually notice our disappearance.”

  As we go in, I slip my hand in his and squeeze.

  Leon and I keep tabs on each other, even when we’re in separate areas of the party, talking with various astronauts and their families. It’s a comfort that lasts me through the rest of the night.

  Since Mom went home early, I’m waiting for Dad to come out front so we can go home. The faint scent of tobacco drifts my way, and my eyes follow the smoke trail. Parked on the street, in front of the house, is the white van I recognize as the one StarWatch uses. Leaning against the car, alone, is the producer from the garden.

  “Hey. Kiara, right?” I say.

  “Good memory.” Her cool demeanor clearly hasn’t changed. “How was your night, kid? Sounds like you and the Tucker kids were able to, uh, have some fun. Might want something to cover that champagne breath—here, hold on a sec.”

  She pulls me to the door of the van, hands me a piece of gum. After it’s in my mouth, she says, “Close your eyes,” and spritzes my face and neck with a soft vanilla-scented spray.

  “This will last you until you get home.” She smirks at my disbelief. “Not my first rodeo, kid.”

  “Thanks. How … did you know?”

  “You’re not the only reporter here, Cal.” She gestures to herself. “And I heard you all chatting around back during my second smoke break out here, just before someone chucked a large glass bottle into the recycling. I made some educated guesses.”

  I laugh—if I wasn’t a little buzzed, I might be more worried. But if she wanted to expose us, she wouldn’t have told me. So I have to trust that there might be a modicum of dignity with Shooting Stars.

  “Mind if I ask you something about StarWatch?” I say.

  “Go for it.”

  “Do you … hate your job? I noticed you at the party, and your expressions only ranged from unenthused to enraged.”

  She shakes her head. “It’s complicated. I think some of this is cool, but it’s hard. We coasted for a few episodes on these parties just being fun and opulent and … champagne-fueled. But Josh has been breathing down my back lately to find a new story or get some drama. And let me tell you, these people are on their best behavior when a camera is on them. We got some really good gossip early into the party, but Josh wants to save it for later.”

  “Isn’t going to Mars dramatic enough?” I ask. “Maybe I’m naive, but there are so many people working on this project—especially outside of the twenty astronauts—that you could focus on.”

  She shakes her head. “I just do what they tell me. That’s why I’m an assistant producer.”

  The Tuckers’ front door swings open. Behind my dad stand Leon and his mom. Leon gives me a wave, and I return it weakly. My cheeks flush with heat. I break away from the van to go see my dad.

  I turn back to Kiara. “Thanks for the … you know. Hope you find your story.”

  “I think I have.” She smirks, and she slowly pans from me to Leon and back. “But we’ll see how it plays out.”

  “Want to drive back?” Dad asks, confirming that he one-hundred-percent does not smell the champagne on my breath or see the blurriness that covers my eyes—I whisper a silent thanks to Kiara.

  I shrug, then look up into the sky. The streetlights are dim, so it feels like you can see all the stars out here. Thousands upon thousands more than Brooklyn, that’s for sure. Dad follows my gaze upward, to the sky, and releases a heavy sigh.

  “Let’s walk back,” I say. “We can pick up the car later this weekend. Maybe you can remind me what all these constellations are, since I haven’t seen them in a while.”

  He puts an arm around my shoulder, and I smell his champagne breath. I know he’s not that drunk—to be honest, I’ve never seen Dad super drunk. But he’s feeling good, and so am I. Which reminds me to breathe downward, since I don’t think he’d be too keen on me secretly drinking during my first week in Clear Lake, and a stick of gum can only do so much.

  “Well, let’s start easy. See those stars that look like a pan?”

  “I know the Big Dipper, Dad,” I say, laughing.

  “What about that one? The five stars that look like a W?”

  “Casio … something, right?”

  He makes an affirmative grunt. “That’s Cassiopeia, and there are a lot more stars than five in it. Can’t really see most of them now, though. And if you look at that pentagon-looking one near it, that’s her husband, Cepheus.”

  “Does Orpheus have a constellation?” I ask.

  “Sort of.” He looks down at me and smiles. “The constellation Lyra is around here. It’s tiny, though, so I won’t be able to spot it. It represents the story of Orpheus and Eurydice.”

  “And that is …?”

  “The brief version? Eurydice dies; Orpheus takes his magical lyre and travels to Hades to save her. He plays his lyre for Hades, who promises to return Eurydice under one condition: she would follow, but if he turned to look at her, she’d be go

ne forever.”

  “How’d that turn out?” I ask.

  “Not well.” He shakes his head. “But it gave us a good name for the project. Orpheus, son of Apollo. A story about trust, and moving forward. It’s clever, I think.”

  We continue walking as Dad points out all the constellations he knows. He even acknowledges his star-mapping skills are rusty. But it’s nice to have this moment.

  “The astronauts are all really welcoming,” he says. “The NASA administrators were too. They kept asking questions about you, since they saw your update. Josh Farrow, though, whoo boy, he was so salty.”

  “Look, I’m really sorry about that. I didn’t think—”

  “Don’t be. NASA loved it. They want this stuff to go viral any way it can, especially to kids your age. They want you to keep doing it, since it’s better than us olds forcing it on them.”

  My cheeks flush, and not because of the champagne this time. “Really? I don’t even know if I want to cover all this. That’s your thing; it seems … weird. Also, don’t say ‘olds’ ever, please.”

  I’m expecting a weight to be lifted off my chest—I didn’t get us all in trouble—but it’s like the weight got swapped with an even larger one. NASA wants me to cover the missions, even though StarWatch is furious about it?

  Anxious energy rattles around in my chest. On one hand, I don’t give a shit about that trashy network or any of its shows, so making them angry kind of sounds fun. But on the other hand, having my content controlled by NASA?

  “Donna said you could tour the facilities anytime you want. See the shuttles. Maybe I can take you to work with me one day. Oh, here.”

  I feel the pressure start to compound when he hands me her business card. When I moved here, I thought I’d only have to manage a new school, keep my head down for a year, and find a way to get back to New York to live with Deb. Within one week, I’ve got a new crush to deal with (and whatever baggage he’s hiding), a pissed-off best friend (and whatever baggage she’s hiding), and now the pressure from NASA along with the wrath of StarWatch (and whatever baggage they’re collectively hiding).
  I don’t want my content controlled by anyone, but a part of me wants to help them. To really shove it in StarWatch’s face. This is the most newsworthy thing going on in America right now, and I have a front-row seat. Now that my BuzzFeed internship imploded, and I have no plan, I feel the need to do something that gives me back the control I had over my life.

  Having this card in my hand feels like an opportunity. One I won’t be wasting.''',

      'The Gravity of Us',
      '''I wake to the sounds of chirping birds, and even without lifting the covers from my face, I take in the Texas sun with my other senses. The summer heat crawls through the room, pushing back the air-conditioning, and I feel its warmth spread over my bed. The window’s shut, but I can still smell the cut grass and the damp humidity.

  After an uneventful weekend of unpacking, delivered meals, and me overanalyzing every text from Leon, it’s Monday morning. It’s Dad’s first day of work. And I can tell by his frenzied back-and-forth pacing, he’s stressed.

  “Oh good, you’re up,” he says as I step outside my room. “Could you get the car this morning? We shouldn’t have left it over at the Tuckers’ all weekend. Mom’s on a work call, I have to fill out the new hire paperwork this morning and be in by noon, and I’m having a slow start. I can’t be late on my first day.”

  I agree, and he leaves, so I jump in the shower and get ready for the day. Unease swims in my blood, in a way that I can’t shake off. And I wonder if I’m starting to act like Mom in new situations.

  There’s something calming about my morning routine. Wake, water, social. A shower so hot it kind of burns my skin even though, yes, that’s not good for my skin, I get it, this is my cross to bear. Next comes the face scrub, oil-free moisturizer—with SPF, because my pale skin can’t even compete with the sun on cloudy days—then just enough hair paste to keep it all in place.

  I’m not obsessed with my looks, which are fine—stubby nose, fanged teeth I wish I could trim down—but I like the process. Taking my time to get ready makes me feel better about myself. Yes, I notice more pimples this way, but I also feel my skin moisturizing, and I get to flip my bangs up in the front. It’s my signature.

  And this is what tethers me to Brooklyn, to home. It’s the same process. The same steps. Sure, I’m doing this in a bigger house, thousands of miles away, but for now, I feel okay. Only okay, but that’s okay.

  Okay.

  I still don’t pull out my John Mayer hat. It’s a kind of porkpie hat with a brim so wide you could wear it to a Southern Baptist church. My style is flamboyant enough as it is, but one day, Texas will be ready.

  I wear a tight white tank top with thin blue horizontal stripes, and jean shorts rolled up a couple of inches higher than they were meant to be. I opt for my strapped sandals. No, not clunky Tevas, but ones with thin leather straps that crawl their way up my leg.

  After I actually settle on an outfit, I’m out the door and down the street, taking in the warming heat before it gets too unbearable. As I approach the house, I feel a little flutter in my stomach, and I remember leaning in to kiss Leon, how much I wanted to be there for him, but I didn’t know how. I also knew it was something beyond me, and I wondered if he was seeing a therapist or taking medication or therapy or Reiki or whatever it is that could help him.

  When I get to the car, I wave to Kat, who’s sitting on the porch. She puts down the book she’s reading and runs over to where I’m standing.

  “Hey!” she says. I take in her spirit and try to make it my own. I’m not sure how she can pull off being so perky when it’s this early. “I wanted to, well, thank you for getting to know Leon.”

  The sentence strikes me off guard. “I like him a lot. But why do you think you have to thank me?”

  “I know he’s my older brother, so it’s weird for me to be saying this. But he doesn’t … make friends that easily. He was so into gymnastics for years, and he had friends on the team, but he just kind of lost interest before the move. Dad’s been trying to force him to keep training, to try to get back on course. But it’s like he hasn’t liked anything or anyone in a long time. Maybe he just needs to get back to the gym or something.”

  “I’m not sure what I can do to help.” I gesture to my scrawny physique and outfit and say plainly, “I am not athletic.”

  My mind drifts to NASA’s invitation to tour the facility and do a post from there. It’s Monday, and I usually do a start-of-the-week video. Since my initial rebellion, I’ve been itching to create new content.

  “Do you want to say hi to Leon? I think he might be up.”

  “I do, but I have to get back home so Dad can get to work,” I say as I take out the business card from my wallet. “It’s okay—we’ll talk later.”

  I dial the number on the card and wait for the NASA social media woman to pick up the phone. I let each ring sound out, even though it’s well into the normal workday at eleven in the morning, and she is most likely busy and wouldn’t want to talk to a guy like—

  “Donna Szleifer, NASA social.”

  “Donna, hi. It’s Cal Junior. The FlashFame guy.”

  I hear a little gasp on her end. “Oh, hi, Cal. I’m so glad you called. I thought you’d be debating my proposition from Friday’s party, and I didn’t even get to talk to you about everything we have planned and what you could help with.”

  “That’s what I’m calling about, actually. I wondered if, maybe I could come up sometime this week and shoot a video?”

  “Not to rush you, but could you do it today? The astronauts are busy all day and we have some social posts scheduled and whatnot, but we could really use the boost of your followers right now. I know StarWatch is doing what they can, but bless them, they can’t get any traction on that FlashFame app, and everyone seems really thirsty for info after your last vid.”

  “Oh. Well, I was going to do a weekly post today anyway, and I guess it would be cool to do it from the space center.”

  There’s a pause on her end. “Perfect. Just perfect. You get your butt down here, and if I have to go put out first-day-of-school fires over here, you can just wander around. I’ll get you a visitor’s pass ready.”

  I look to the front of the house and see that Kat’s long gone, but in her place is a sleepy guy who’s so cute I could literally melt right here, leaving nothing but my hipster tank and unraveled sandals on the hot pavement.

  “Can I bring Leon Tucker?” I ask quickly. “I need someone to film me.”

  “Two passes, then! Come along with your dad, and I’ll get you guys.”

  I can’t help but admire Leon, all lanky and tall, with a lazy smile and his wrinkled T-shirt and gym shorts like he just got out of bed. I walk up to him, smile briefly, and take in the discrepancy of our outfits. A smirk forms on my face, just before he leans in and gives me a hug. I feel his arms wrap around me, and I’m so caught off guard by it that I almost gasp.

  Yes, this is how some people say hello, but that’s not exactly what we do in Brooklyn, so I’m a bit alarmed by it. And comforted by it. And kind of never want it to stop.

  But, unfortunately, it stops.

  “Hey, Cal.”

  There’s a slight drawl in how he says my name, and I almost die at the sweetness. This crush is strong. This crush is too powerful. This crush will be the end of me.

  Or maybe I’m just being dramatic.

  “I’m going to the space center to record a Flash vid. They said I could bring you. Want to come?”

  “They?”

  “Yeah, the social media woman I met at the party.”

  There’s a weird silence in how he sizes me up just now. His eyes narrow, and he shakes his head almost imperceptibly, but in a flash, he drops all the tightness in his body. He relaxes, and offers a genuine smile, and nods.

  “Yeah, I’ll go. Let me get changed.”

  “Okay, be quick. I have to pick up Dad so I can take him to work.”

  He’s very quick. Like, he literally just changed his shirt and threw on

some shorts and called it a day. He didn’t shower. Which, I guess, is fine. He doesn’t smell bad or anything. And his shirt is actually cute—it’s a plain T-shirt, but it’s a pale, soft blue. The kind you see on the crayons that get used up first in a huge box. The color pops in contrast to his dark brown skin.

  I get the urge to kiss him again. He’s not low right now, and nowhere in my perverse mind do I think he needs this kiss to fix him. I want him, and I want to do it for me. And for humanity, even. I want the world to be that much better because of our lips touching and his hand in my hair and …

  My heart is racing. Thudding against my rib cage and shaking my body. I’ve never been able to go back and forth between being so perfectly content and so perfectly lustful of someone so quick. It’s like a switch. And I want it to keep flipping on and off. On and off.

  I stop outside the house and call Dad, who comes out dressed in a sharp suit and tie. He’s carrying this boxy briefcase I’ve never seen before. It’s all somewhat adorable, and this must be what parents feel like taking their anxious and/or excited children to their first day of school.

  Swap the briefcase for a carry-on bag, and it’s not too far off from his Delta days. But he definitely carries himself straighter now. His smile comes easily, and his giddiness takes over the car the moment he steps in.

  “Thanks, Cal. And good morning, Mr. Tucker.”

  Leon gives an uncomfortable laugh at the formal title. I make eye contact with Dad in the rearview as he buckles up in the back seat.

  I look up directions on my phone, and see that Deb’s sent me a ton of listings for studios all over Brooklyn, from Lefferts Gardens to Bay Ridge and everywhere in between, so she can’t be that angry with me for how self-centered I was acting when we last spoke.

  Brooklyn is where I’ll live; Manhattan is where I’ll work and go to school. Texas simply doesn’t fit into the equation. But I can’t hide the fact that, even though I so recently fell into this opulent and bizarre world, the thought of leaving makes my chest ache with regret.

  We pull up to the gate, and I pass Dad’s ID to the guard. He lets us in, and I wonder if Dad feels embarrassed now, having his kid drive him to his first day of work, in one of the most respected professions in the world.

  But if he feels that way, he doesn’t say it … and he is the type of person who would say it.

  Dad leads us in through the main gate and shows us around the various labs and the gift shop and points us to the section where they have a pop-up Mercury and Apollo museum with pieces of the old spacecraft that he got to touch on his last interview.

  “Cal!”

  Both Dad and I turn—sharing my name with Dad is the bane of my existence—to see Donna running toward us, iPhone flailing precariously in her loose-wristed grip. She smiles at the three of us and clarifies:

  “Cal Junior, that is.”

  Dad looks deflated, but he smiles anyway, and gives me a quick nod to instruct me to follow her out. I want to stay and make sure he knows that she didn’t mean anything by it, that he matters to this mission one bajillion times more than I do. But I don’t.

  And I know I’ve hurt him. Just by existing. By being needed in the one place where it should have been him. For the second time, I’ve stolen his thunder.

  Leon and I join Donna as she talks to us about the tour she’ll take us on and points out about fifty “really special” places for video shots. Leon’s participation in the conversation dwindles to nonexistence, so when she turns a sharp corner and we’re momentarily alone, I place a hand softly on his shoulder and squeeze.

  “This is overwhelming, huh?” I say. “I don’t think she’s taken a breath since we left the lobby.”

  He laughs. “Yeah, she’s … something.”

  “Hmm,” I say after a bit of hesitation. “We could shake her and do some exploring. Find some ‘really special’ places of our own.”

  He side-eyes me, so I laugh and break into a jog to catch up to Donna, who’s still chattering. Even as I find my niche, and I start to fit in around here … as I start to feel a little happy, a little positive or hopeful or whatever it is, I think of my dad. His smile faltering, while Donna made a show of taking me around. It’s not fair to him.

  But something in me wants to hold tightly to this. With BuzzFeed out of the picture, it’s all I have.

  I can’t give it up. Even if it hurts my dad.''',

      'FROM SIDEKICK TO BIGSHOT',
      '''As Jian Yiling left the room and walked up the stairs, Wen Nuan suddenly glanced at her from downstairs.

When their eyes met and Wen Nuan had an expression that was filled with warmth and sorrow. She appeared to have wanted to say something but instead, she hesitated.

Her daughter was cherished by her from a young age, however...

Wen Nuan started to cry in Jian Shuxing’s arms. She sobbed, “It’s all my fault, I spoiled Yiling too much...”

Although Jian Shuxing had been in the corporate world for many years and had been through various matters, large or small, he had never frowned and creased his brows. However, today’s event made his eyes red.

“No, it’s not all your fault, I’m also in the wrong. Fortunately, it’s not too late to educate her. If we start teaching her properly, Yiling can still fix her ways,” Jian Shuxing said whilst gently patting his wife’s back.

Jian Shuxing was not in a good frame of mind either. He had to admit that out of their four children, he and his wife spoiled their daughter a bit more as she was the youngest and the only girl.

However, this did not mean he didn’t love his other three children. When such a thing happened to his third son, he felt terrible.

The married couple looked at each other, their eyes filled with sadness, lament, responsibility, and reluctance.

The emotion that showed up in their eyes was foreign to Jian Yiling.

In her past life, when her parents had discovered her talents, they had signed a contract with an institute and left her there. In return, every year, the institute would send a large sum of money to her parents.

Jian Yiling rarely had a chance to interact with her parents. On the rare occasions where she got to meet her parents, their eyes were filled with coldness and indifference that made her feel that she was miles away from them. Even if there were words of care regarding her well-being, it was done in a manner that felt as though it was a memorized and prepared speech. There was never any warmth in that.

However, the couple looked at her in a manner that affected her greatly. It made no sense to her yet her emotions were running rampant.

Perhaps in this matter, they didn’t choose to believe in Jian Yiling. However, their love for Jian Yiling was real.

Wen Nuan suddenly left her husband’s embrace and ran up the stairs to come to Jian Yiling’s side.

The fifteen-year-old Jian Yiling looked quite petite and small compared to her peers as she had a premature birth.

She had a small doll-like face with delicate features. Even at the age of fifteen, she still had a bit of baby fat on her face that had not grown away.

At this moment, Jian Yiling’s silence made Wen Nuan feel even more terrible.

Wen Nuan lowered her voice and severely scolded Jian Yiling. “Yiling, you must admit your mistake this time. In a bit, your father and I will go to the hospital to see your third brother. You must come with me and go say sorry to him! You need to go ask for his forgiveness! If you don’t correct yourself, even your father and I won’t forgive you!”

Wen Nuan had never been so strict with Jian Yiling before.

Jian Yiling nodded.

She knew that there was no point in trying to explain herself at this moment.

If she kept trying to deny that she did it, she would follow the footsteps of Jian Yiling from the novel. That would push herself to a precarious position.

In the evening, Wen Nuan asked Aunt An to make some tonic soup and some dishes. After placing the food into a thermal mug, Wen Nuan dragged Jian Yiling with her to the hospital.

The Jian residence was in the middle of the mountains. This area was filled with villas that were owned by powerful and influential individuals of the Hengyuan City.

The hospital that Jian Yunnao was residing in was half an hour ride away from their house. It was the best private hospital in Hengyuan City.

When they arrived at the hospital ward, they saw their son’s arm hoisted to frame, his face pale and lifeless, their hearts filled with pain.

Jian Yunnao and Jian Yuncheng had similar facial features. They both were exquisite and sharp.

However, compared to the older brother, Jian Yunnao’s features were softer and more tender.

Yet right now, his tender features exhibited sorrow, and his eyes were filled with despair.

Jian Yunnao was only seventeen years old. Encountering such an experience affected him too much.

Jian Yuncheng sat next to Jian Yunnao in silence.

His face was shrouded with gloom.

“Yunnao, mummy asked Aunt An to make your favorite dishes. Would you eat a little?” Wen Nuan asked gently as she walked up.

Jian Yunnao immediately turned his head to the side.

Wen Nuan knew that her son was upset.

She continued to comfort him beside the bed and hoped that he could open up to her.

Jian Yuncheng told his mother that, “Mo Shiyun had visited a while ago. She brought some food and fed third brother.”''',

      '''After hearing those words, Wen Nuan paused for a bit before replying, “That’s good. It’s good to have eaten. If you eat well, your hands will recover. Don’t worry, your dad has already contacted the best surgeon for you.”

Wen Nuan knew Mo Shiyun. She was the daughter of Aunt Mo who was a servant of her household.

Aunt Mo was a pitiful person. Her husband had passed away and she had to take care of her child by herself. Due to this reason, she had pleaded for her child to live with her as she served the Jian family.

Wen Nuan hadn’t refused. Aunt Mo was incredibly diligent with her work. An additional child only meant one extra mouth to feed. And a child didn’t eat a lot in the first place. The Jian family did not lack that amount of money.

Mo Shiyun and Jian Yunnao were of similar age and they got along well.

The quarrel between Jian Yunnao and Jian Yiling this time was due to Mo Shiyun. However, Wen Nuan knew that she couldn’t blame Mo Shiyun, as it was her daughter who was too petty. Regardless of how much her brother loved her, it was impossible for him to not have any other friends.

Jian Yunnao suddenly spoke, his voice low and lifeless, “Don’t lie to me. The nerves in my hands are broken. There is no way that it will become better. I will never be able to play music again! I’ll just be a handicapped person!”

“Don’t say that... Yunnao... Mummy knows that you feel awful... It’s mummy’s fault...” Wen Nuan cried as she apologized to her son.

“Why are you apologizing? Shouldn’t you get her to come to apologize to me?! She should compensate by one of her hands! Then I won’t argue with her anymore!”

“Yunnao, she’s your younger sister... And she’s still a child, I... I...” Wen Nuan didn’t know what to do anymore.

When Jian Shuxing saw his wife crying silently, he quickly told him to stop, ” Yunnao, don’t force your mother!”

“Yes, I’m forcing her! I’m the one who is forcing her. You all only know to protect Yiling. Only she is your child. And I’m not!” Jian Yunnao was furious. He usually would never be mad if they had spoiled his younger sister a bit more. However, now he had lost both his hands. His emotions had completely fallen apart.

Jian Yuncheng promptly prevented the argument from furthering. “Yunnao, although mother and father are in the wrong. However, if you ask our mother and father to go and break Yiling’s hands, that’s not realistic either. You need to calm down. Everyone is trying to think of ways to help your hands. And they will give Yiling the punishment she deserves. Brother promises you.”

Jian Yuncheng’s words made Jian Yunnao calm down quite a bit. He still listened to his elder brother quite a bit and he knew he couldn’t break his younger sisters’ hands.

Even if his younger sisters’ hands were broken, his hands wouldn’t get better.

At the door of the ward, Jian Yiling watched everything in the room. Her eyes fell on Jian Yunnao’s injured hand which was suspended by the frame.

There were many instruments nailed on his hands.

Jian Yiling knew from a glance that the nerves in Yunnao’s hands were injured. If he wanted his hand to recover completely, then he had to perform a surgical repair on the nerves,

It was a very difficult operation and currently, there were not many surgeons who could do so.

Otherwise, the financial power of the Jian family would have arranged an operation for Jian Yunnao already.

In the original novel, Jian Yunnao’s hands never completely recovered. And thus, his entire pianist career had been cut off. Due to this, Jian Yunnao became incredibly depressed and his world became incredibly gloomy.

And because his parents continued to care about Jian Yiling, the relationship between Jian Yunnao and his parents became incredibly poor.

And in his gloomy world, the heroine Mo Shiyun became his only source of light.

Jian Yiling looked down on her own hands. She was able to do this type of surgery. She had the technology and had experience in countless operations.

When Jian Yiling was at the research institute, she had focused on drug research. However, at the same time, she achieved outstanding successes in many surgical operations and became highly recognized domestically.

At that time, Jian Yiling’s operations were even auctioned by the institute.

However, her hands could not perform such a sophisticated operation right now. She needed the correct technology and she needed to train her hands to not shake during the operation.

And that required a period of training.''',

      '''At this time, Jian Yuncheng noticed Jian Yiling at the door of the ward. He got up and quickly walked to the door.

Jian Yuncheng was more than 1.8metres tall. The fifteen-year-old Jian Yiling in front of him appeared to be especially small. The top of her head just reached his chest.

Jian Yiling wore a simple white sweater. Her face was white as well and she appeared to look like a fluffy little rabbit. However, that was only her appearance. Her heart was most likely all black.

“Go in and apologize.”

He spoke in a simple, yet commanding tone that demanded obedience.

“He will get angry.”

Jian Yiling’s voice sounded soft and immature. She didn’t want her words to sound like that. However, this body was only fifteen years old.

At the same time, Jian Yiling’s speech was very slow. It was almost as though she spoke word by word. Yet, the reason for this was because she was too unfamiliar talking with relatives.

“Now you know that he will get angry? Did you think about him getting angry before you did what you did? Getting angry is probably the least of it!” Jian Yuncheng said, his eyes red and his aura terrifying.

“No, I’m not scared of him being angry and blaming me,” Jian Yiling explained. “I just think that being angry will be bad for his hands.”

She intended to cure his hands. However, he couldn’t wreck his hands further. If he were to wreck his hands further, she wouldn’t be able to help him.

“When did you start stammering? Are you scared?” Jian Yuncheng asked.

Jian Yiling’s natural voice coupled with her slow and stumbling way of speaking made Jian Yuncheng mistaken that she was scared.

Jian Yiling didn’t explain. She wasn’t scared but rather, she wasn’t good at communicating with ‘family’. In her previous life, she met her parents once every year. And every time they met, they did not exchange more than ten sentences

Ever since she learned how to think, she had lived in the research institute. Most of her time was spent in the laboratory. She was familiar with work discussions and not everyday discussions.

Jian Yuncheng coldly warned Jian Yiling, “I don’t care whether you are afraid or you are genuinely worried about Yunnao’s emotions. In this matter, you must work hard to strive for his forgiveness. If Yunnao doesn’t forgive you, then I won’t forgive you either.”

Jian Yuncheng was someone who didn’t go back on his words. Since he said that, he would certainly follow through, even if Jian Shuxing and Wen Nuan asked him not to.

Jian Yiling nodded.

“Go apologize now,” Jian Yuncheng said. He insisted that Jian Yiling should go and apologize to Jian Yunnao. “I’ll pay attention to his injured right hand.”

Hearing this, JianYiling entered the ward.

As soon as Jian Yunnao saw Jian Yiling enter, he became incredibly angry. If it was not for Jian Yuncheng who held him down, he would have jumped up already.

“Jian Yiling! Are you happy now?! I’m crippled! I won’t be able to play the piano for the rest of my life! My entire life is ruined! Are you happy now?!” Jian Yunnao yelled, his words filled with fury.

Jian Yiling didn’t run away. She stood there and accepted his anger.

Seeing Jian Yiling’s calm demeanor, Jian Yunnao’s anger did not lessen at all.

Losing his most important hands made Jian Yunnao’s heart become enveloped in a dark cloud.

His life, his pride, and his dreams were all ruined.

And the source of all this started from when Jian Yiling started arguing with him!

He was angry, he was sad and most importantly, he hated her!

Jian Yunnao violently picked up the lunch next to him with his uninjured left hand and threw it at Jian Yiling’s head.''',

      '''This was the lunchbox that Mo Shiyun had given Jian Yunnao. Jian Yunnao had no appetite and had only eaten a little of it. Most of the food was leftover in the lunch box.

He moved too fast and the other three people in the room had no time to stop him.

The plastic lunch box hit Jian Yiling on the head. All the food fell from her head to her feet.

“Yiling!” Wen Nuan cried out and hurriedly ran over.

If it were the former Jian Yiling who encountered such a thing, she would have been making a lot of noise and throwing a tantrum already.

However, the Jian Yiling of now just took everything silently, without saying a single word.

“I’m fine,” Jian Yiling said as she used the back of her hand to wipe the stain on her face.

She didn’t complain, didn’t blame anyone, and didn’t feel wronged.

She just took everything silently.

“What’s wrong? Do you feel wronged? I just hit you once and you can’t stand it no more?”

Jian Yunnao’s sarcastic voice rang out as he saw his mother worrying about Jian Yiling. His mood became even more unpleasant.

Wen Nuan’s hands froze.

She was stuck in between two injured children and she didn’t know what to do.

The atmosphere in the ward became dull and solemn for a while.

Jian Yiling said, “I-, I’m going to the bathroom.”

With that, Jian Yiling turned to leave the ward. She didn’t want to make the situation awkward for her parents.

As Wen Nuan looked at Jian Yiling’s battered figure from behind, her heart was filled with grievance. However, she knew that she had to harden her heart.

After a brief cleaning of herself in the bathroom, she returned to the entrance of the ward by herself.

Wen Nuan was waiting for her outside the ward. When she saw Jian Yiling come back, her heart was in a dilemma. She didn’t know what to say to Jian Yiling.

“I’ll be outside, waiting for you guys,” Jian Yiling said.

Wen Nuan looked down at her and hesitated for a while before saying, “Okay, then mummy will go in first. Stay here and don’t wander far.”

After Wen Nuan returned inside the ward, the family began to shift the topic. The atmosphere eased and harmonized.

Whilst Jian Yunnao’s expression was still one of despair, faced with the care and love of his parents, he didn’t resist any longer.

Jian Yiling looked at the picture of the family through the gap of the door.

Jian Yiling knew that if she went in right now, she would destroy this harmonious scene completely.

After staying for an hour, Wen Nuan asked her husband to take her daughter back first. She would stay back and take care of Jian Yunnao.

Her son’s hand was injured and at this time, he needed company the most.

And thus, Jian Shuxing left to take Jian Yuncheng and Jian Yiling home.

On the way back, Jian Yuncheng sat next to the driver whilst Jian Yiling and their father Jian Shuxing sat in the back row.

“I’ll help you take a week’s leave with the school. During this time, you should reflect upon yourself.”

The words came from Jian Yuncheng from the front seat. He had an obvious hostility directed towards Jian Yiling.

When Jian Shuxing saw that Jian Yuncheng had such a tough attitude towards his sister, he said, “Yuncheng, Yiling is only in the first year of high school. I don’t think it’s good to take a week’s leave.”

“Compared to studying, the first thing she has to do now is learning how to be a person! Dad, don’t forget what you and mom promised me!” Jian Yuncheng reminded.

Jian Shuxing had agreed to Jian Yuncheng that he’d be stricter with his daughter. He didn’t think that he would instinctively start to protect her before they had even arrived home.

Jian Shuxing was also put in a difficult spot. He had spoiled his daughter for fifteen years already. It was difficult for him to suddenly change his attitude.

However, when he thought of his third son in the hospital, Jian Shuxing forced himself to maintain a serious expression.''',

      '''Jian Yuncheng continued to talk to Jian Yiling. “Take a week of leave from school and reflect on what you did. Do you hear me?”

The way he dealt with things was more swift and decisive than their father.

Jian Yiling nodded and agreed firmly.

Resting at home for a few days was also good for her.

When this happened in the original novel, Jian Yuncheng had also treated Jian Yiling harshly.

However, it was not because Jian Yuncheng didn’t want to recognize this sister of his. But rather, it was because she was his younger sister, he had to be strict with her. He wished for his young sister to become a better person.

As Jian Yuncheng was the eldest, he rather treasured his younger sister.

And because he had high hopes, he appeared to be so strict.

However, Jian Yiling had failed to notice the intentions of her elder brother. Rather, due to Jian Yuncheng’s attitude, their relationship became tenser and tenser.

Neither of these two would directly reveal their true feelings. One is introverted whilst the other was rebellious.

Neither of them would admit defeat which led to misunderstandings and eventually, the dislike of one another.

And in the end, Jian Yuncheng lost his sister completely. He transferred the affection he had for his sister onto the mature, sensible and understanding female lead, Mo Shiyun. Later on, he was a great help to Mo Shiyun.

After reaching home, Jian Shuxing and Jian Yuncheng both had things to deal with so they both went to their respective rooms.

Jian Yiling didn’t immediately go back to her room. Rather, she went to her second brothers’ study room in an attempt to find a microscope.

Every child of the Jian family had their own study room. The second brother of the Jian family was currently studying biology overseas.

To facilitate his studies and research, the second brother of the Jian family had set up a small laboratory that included several microscopes.

Among them, there was one that was used for medicine. It was extremely valuable and ordinary people would definitely not have such equipment in the house.

Of course, there remained a gap between this microscope and the one which was used for surgery. However, for now, this was sufficient enough for Jian Yiling to practice with.

As it was very troublesome to carry the microscope, Jian Yiling simply decided to stay in her second brother’s laboratory to practice operation exercises.

Jian Yiling’s first experiment items were eggs that she took from the kitchen. She stitched together the membrane of the egg surface.

After damaging a few eggs, Jian Yiling went to the kitchen again and this time she took a pig’s foot to experiment with.

Other than staying in her second brother’s study room, Jian Yiling spent the remainder of her time surfing the internet. She typed furiously on her keyboard and appeared to be very busy.

Whilst Jian Yiling was concentrating and being busy, the Jian family welcomed a special person. Seventeen-year-old Qin Chuan.

He was the male lead for the original novel.

In the original novel, the male lead’s mother was the first love of the head of the richest and most powerful family of Beijing. It was after they broke up that the mother realized that she was pregnant.

Later, she gave birth to the male lead and raised him by herself. The life of the mother and son was quite difficult. However, the male lead worked very hard and relied on himself to achieve great heights.

At this time, Qin Chuan did not know that he was the illegitimate child of the aristocrats. He also did not know that he would become the leader of the aristocrats in the future.

The reason why he appeared at the Jian family right now was that he got a well-paid job from Jian Yuncheng. The pay for this job could help him solve the problem with his tuition fees.

The details of this job asked him to be Jian Yiling’s private tutor. While tutoring Jian Yiling’s studies, the most important thing was to teach Jian Yiling how to become a better person or to ‘turn over a new leaf’.

In the original novel, Qin Chuan became Jian Yiling’s private tutor.

With an outstanding appearance and a patient way of teaching, he became a beacon of light to Jian Yiling who felt as though she was distrusted by her family and betrayed by the rest of the world.''',

      '''At that time, although Qin Chuan did not have a prominent identity, he was still a special existence for Jian Yiling.

It was a pity that after he stopped being her private tutor, Jian Yiling had lost all contact with Qin Chuan.

However, Jian Yiling had never forgotten him.

When Jian Yiling saw Qin Chuan again, he was the same as how she remembered him. However, he had grown more mature and his identity had changed too. He turned from a penniless boy to a corporate big shot.

However, Jian Yiling didn’t care about those things. She only knew that she liked him and when she was abandoned by the rest of the world, he was the only one who stayed with her.

However, Qin Chuan had fallen in love with Mo Shiyun.

Compared to Jian Yiling who had been pampered and spoiled since a child, he got along better with Mo Shiyun who relied on her own efforts to achieve results. Both of them loved each other and became an ideal couple where the man was talented and the woman was beautiful.

And at that time, Jian Yiling had become completely paranoid. As she couldn’t give up Qin Chuan, she decided to destroy him.

She would destroy what she couldn’t get.

However, in the end, the only person she managed to ruin was herself.

Even if the Jian Yiling of right now knew that Qin Chuan was going to be the leader of the wealthiest individuals in Beijing, she had no interest in him.

Jian Yiling didn’t want to get involved with Qin Chuan. When she got told that Qin Chuan was in her brother’s study room, Jian Yiling hid in her room and didn’t go out.

However, Jian Yiling could avoid him for a day, but she couldn’t avoid him forever.

Soon, Jian Yuncheng came to Jian Yiling’s study to come find her. He wanted her to go to his study room to talk.

Jian Yiling followed him and listened to him about the matters of finding her a private tutor.

That was the first time that Qin Chuan met Jian Yiling.

She was a relatively petite girl who wore a white sweater and slim black pants.

With long hair, pale skin, and large eyes, she had the usual good looks of the Jian family.

This was also the first time that Jian Yiling had officially met Qin Chuan. As he was the male lead, his attractiveness did not have to be questioned.

He also had a contradictory temperament. Although he was a poor student who needed to work to earn enough tuition, he also exuded a noble feeling.

Jian Yiling knew that this contradictory temperament was due to his special background. Although he was currently poor, he would become someone that the Jian family would look up to in the future.

Jian Yuncheng introduced him to Jian Yiling, “This is Qin Chuan. He will be your private tutor from today onwards. During the week that you’re taking off from school, he’ll be responsible for your studies. After that, when you return to school, he’ll come over on the weekends and give you supplementary lessons. Qin Chuan graduated from the No.1 High School here in Hengyuan. And now, he’s attending Hengyuan’s best university. He has top marks for studies and great behavior at school. You need to learn well from him.”

In fact, Qin Chuan could attend the best universities in the country with his college entrance exam marks.

However, his mother was always sick and his family didn’t have the money.

In an attempt to save money and take care of his mother, Qin Chuan decided to stay in Hengyuan City.

“Got it,” Jian Yiling answered simply.

Jian Yiling’s attitude was rather rigid. For her, accepting a private tutor was her way of saying that she was willing to accept their good intentions.

However, her soft voice accompanied by her appearance stunned Qin Chuan. It made him think of her as obedient and understanding.

As Qin Chuan looked at her, he felt that Jian Yiling was quite different from what he had heard.

Since he was coming to become a private tutor for the Jian family, Qin Chuan had inquired about the family situation beforehand.

At the same time, he knew what had happened at Shenghua High School from the numerous posts on the online forum.

Everyone was saying that Jian Yiling has always been oppressive and overbearing. Apparently, she had pushed her brother Jian Yunnao down the stairs. Students in the school thus requested the school to expel Jian Yiling.

However, Qin Chuan knew of the influence the Jian family had in Hengyuan City. As long as the Jian family did not give up on Jian Yiling, the school would definitely not expel her.

Despite knowing that Jian Yiling was not easy to deal with, he still took the job from Jian Yuncheng. This was simply because of the price Jian Yuncheng had offered him and he desperately needed money.

As long as he could earn enough money for his living expenses and his mother’s medical expenses, it didn’t matter if the process was difficult. A troublesome and difficult student shouldn’t be what he should consider.

However, after seeing the girl in person, Qin Chuan was surprised to find out that the girl did not appear to be as arrogant and unreasonable as the rumors had told.

He couldn’t yet finalize whether it was because the rumors were wrong or the girl was just pretending to be obedient.''',

      '''“Yiling will trouble you for a while then,” Jian Yuncheng said to Qin Chuan. To which Qin Chuan replied, “Don’t worry.”

“Then let’s start today. You’ll have to work quite hard this week.”

“That is fine.”

Working hard wasn’t a problem. If he did private tutoring every day, this meant that he could get a generous pay daily.

And Jian Yuncheng had promised him that he would pay the tuition fees at the end of every day.

This would be able to solve the problems that he had with paying the medical expenses of his mother’s hospitalization.

If he were to be completely honest, Jian Yiling taking a break from school was timely assistance for Qin Chuan.

Afterward, Qin Chuan went with Jian Yiling to her study room.

Jian Yiling’s study room was more like a little girl. The Jian family only had one daughter, so of course, they had raised her like a little princess. The study room was delicate and filled with the color pink.

Jian Yiling certainly did not like this pink theme. It didn’t fit her inner temperament at all.

However, Jian Yiling didn’t have time to modify the layout and style of her room. She had more important things to do.

As soon as Qin Chuan entered Jian Yiling’s study room, he felt the vibe of a young immature girl.

It seemed like she was indeed the little princess of the Jian family. But according to the words he had heard from the forum, they had called her a devil.

Qin Chuan did not have any interest in this little girl. It didn’t matter to him whether she was a devil or a princess, she was just a task that he needed to complete.

Qin Chuan took out the test paper Jian Yiling did for her last monthly exam.

Jian Yiling only just started at high school. The results of her first monthly exam were incredibly poor.

Out of Chinese, Mathematics, English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Politics, and History, she had failed six units and passed the remaining three with low grades.

Her academic performance could be described as ‘tragic’.

Qin Chuan asked Jian Yiling to re-correct the wrong questions on the test paper.

“I’ll correct them myself first. If there are any mistakes, you can point them out for me,” Jian Yiling said as she tried to avoid as much contact with Qin Chuan as possible.

Jian Yiling was still not used to communicating with people so she spoke slower than normal people.

When Qin Chuan saw Jian Yiling insisting to do it that way, he did not force her to do it some other way. He sat down on the sofa next to her and waited for Jian Yiling to finish the questions.

Jian Yiling took advantage of Qin Chuan not paying attention to place the test paper underneath something. She took out her phone and started typing.

If Qin Chuan were to walk over right now, he would see that all the words that Jian Yiling was typing were English.

After a while, Qin Chuan came over to check how Jian Yiling was progressing with correcting the mistakes.

When Qin Chuan came over, Jian Yiling hid her phone and acted seemingly focused on the problem.

Qin Chuan glanced over the question that Jian Yiling was answering.

He found out that although Jian Yiling had only corrected one question, she did it right.

There were no problems with her problem-solving procedure either.

The progress was a bit slow, so Qin Chuan decided to explain the questions whilst Jian Yiling corrected her answers.

As Qin Chuan approached, Jian Yiling carefully swiped her phone from under the test paper onto her thigh.

Qin Chuan didn’t see Jian Yiling’s phone. He only saw her cowering.

It seemed like she was very timid?

Qin Chuan didn’t think too much into it and began to explain a question to Jian Yiling.

Qin Chuan spoke incredibly well. He explained a complicated topic into simple words making it easy to understand. When he talked about key points, Qin Chuan took a pen and paper from Jian Yiling and wrote it down so it would be convenient for her to review later.

While he was holding the pen and paper, Qin Chuan accidentally touched Jian Yiling’s hands. Jian Yiling had immediately avoided him.

Her reaction was akin to a frightened little rabbit.

At that moment, Qin Chuan felt as though he had bullied a little girl.

However, Jian Yiling only reacted that way because she was afraid to have contact with strangers. Especially if the stranger was Qin Chuan. That sort of reaction was instinctive to her.''',

      '''At night, after Jian Shuxing returned from the company, he took Jian Yiling to the old Jian Residence.

Jian Yiling’s grandparents had heard about what had happened in the past two days, so they wanted Jian Shuxing to bring Jian Yiling over.

Jian Yunnao’s situation was quite serious as it affected his future. Jian Shuxing didn’t want to hide it from his parents.

The grandparents of the Jian family lived alone in the old Jian Residence. Their children had all become independent.

However, when anything happened, everyone would still go back to the old Jian Residence.

Whenever it was Chinese New Year or other festivities, they would all go to accompany their grandparents.

It took half an hour’s drive to get to the old Jian Residence.

When they arrived at the door, the black iron gates opened automatically and the car drove into the courtyard.

The old Jian Residence has a typical medieval-styled European building.

In the old Jian Residence, the grandparents had been waiting for a long time already.

Although Grandpa Jian had retired, he remained imposing.

Whilst he had white hair and a thin body, his bones were still sturdy. However, when he was young, he had not taken care of himself well, so when the weather was bad, his bones would hurt again.

Grandma Jian also had white hair, but she remained dignified and had a sense of nobility around her.

As soon as Jian Shuzhen entered the door holding Jian Yiling’s hands, Grandma Jian came over and pulled Jian Yiling to her side.

“My precious child, were you scared?” Grandma Jian asked as she leaned over and comforted Jian Yiling.

“Mum, this time it was Yiling who did something wrong,” Jiang Shuxing said whilst frowning. When his mother acted that way, it made it seem like Yiling was the one who was wronged.

Grandma Jian did not care at all, “Stop your nonsense. How much strength would Yiling have? To be able to push someone off the stairs? And besides, Yunnao is her brother, how could Yiling intentionally push him off? He fell off by himself accidentally when they were arguing. And he has to say that Yiling pushed him on purpose. Is this how you act like a father? Yiling isn’t a bad child!”

Unlike her parents, Grandma Jian firmly believed in Jian Yiling.

Grandma Jian had given birth to three sons herself. She didn’t have a daughter and she had always wanted one.

She didn’t have any hope of having another child herself, so she could only count on her sons.

However, who would have thought that her three sons have birth to eight grandsons! Not one of them being a girl.

Grandma Jian was rather confused at that.

Finally, after the birth of Jian Yiling, there was a baby girl in the family. Grandma Jian had been incredibly delighted.

Naturally, she cared for her granddaughter more than the other grandchildren.

She frequently called Jian Yiling to come over to educate her herself.

Grandma Jian had so many grandchildren. However, the one who stayed with her the longest was Jian Yiling. Before Jian Yiling turned five, Grandma Jian brought her up half the time.

This was the child that she had brought up. She knew in her heart what Yiling would and would not do.

Grandma Jian felt that although the child was a bit arrogant and didn’t have a great temper, she was not bad at heart. And it was due to this, that she would definitely not push her brother off the stairs!

As for the temper, what was wrong with that? She was the only daughter of the Jian family.

Jian Shuxing sighed, “Mother, you can not indulge and spoil Yiling like this. Yiling did something wrong. Wen Nuan and I are trying our best to teach her. When you do this, you put all our efforts into waste.”

Grandma Jian refused to listen, “And? What’s the matter? Are you saying that I don’t teach well? Did I not bring up the three of you? And now that I’m old, do you think that I can’t teach children?”

“Mother, that’s not what I meant...” Jian Shuxing said as he tried to explain. How did he become the unfilial son all of a sudden when he was trying to explain?''',

      '''“Anyhow, Yiling didn’t do anything wrong! I believe her! Also, fire the servant in your house. Since Yiling doesn’t like her, why are you keeping her? You spend money for a servant to take care of her master, not to make the master upset!” Grandma Jian turned her head away. She spoke in a way where she was not going to change her mind at all.

Jian Yiling looked at the two people arguing in front of her. She stretched out her hand and pulled at Grandma Jian’s sleeve.

Grandma Jian lowered her head to look at her.

“Don’t argue, I am in the wrong.”

Jian Yiling was indeed partly wrong. She shouldn’t have argued with her brother because he made friends with someone of the opposite gender.

On this issue, the original Jian Yiling was indeed guilty of being narrow-minded and petty.

As for whether or not she pushed him, Jian Yiling didn’t want to make a meaningless argument.

Insisting that she didn’t do it in front of her grandparents, yet not being able to produce any evidence would only disappoint her parents and brothers even more. There would not be any positive effects.

“Yiling, you... ” Grandma Jian said in surprise.

Hearing Jian Yiling sincerely say these words made Jian Shuxing’s heart feel touched.

He could see that this time, she knew where she went wrong.

At that moment, Grandpa Jian who had remained silent ever since Jian Yiling entered the room spoke, “Yiling, come here.”

Grandpa Jian waved at Jian Yiling.

After hesitating for a moment, Jian Yiling approached him carefully.

Grandpa Jian sat on the sofa and stretched out his hand to pat Jian Yiling’s head. “I had originally wanted you to come over to ask how your father dealt with the situation. Given that you admitted your mistake by yourself, this makes grandpa very pleased.”

Similar to Grandma Jian, Grandpa Jian had also pampered his only granddaughter a bit more. If there was anything his granddaughter wanted, nothing was stopping him from giving it to her.

However, Grandpa Jian was the head of the Jian family. And this time, the person who got severely affected was a child from the Jian family. It was necessary to sort out what was right and wrong.

Grandpa Jian’s face finally calmed down and he said to his darling granddaughter, “I’ll think of what happened to your brother as an event of the past. After all, investigating it further will not change the fact that your brother’s hand is injured. However, there should be punishment. Everything that needs to be done afterward has to be done! Also, do not repeat this incidence. Do you understand?”

Jian Yiling nodded.

Grandpa Jian continued, “It doesn’t matter if you’re ruthless to outsiders as a child of the Jian family. But you absolutely must not hurt anyone in the family. Considering that you are young and that this is the first offense, we won’t go on further about this matter.”

Jian Yiling nodded again.

Jian Yiling didn’t doubt at all that Grandpa Jian would punish her.

In the original novel, it was Grandpa Jian that ordered Jian Yiling to be kicked out of the Jian family.

However, Grandma Jian couldn’t stand looking at this anymore. She stepped forward and pulled Jian Yiling away from Grandpa Jian.

“You old man! Why are you so fierce to her? Are you trying to scare her!”

Although Grandma Jian said that, she was still afraid of what Grandpa Jian could do.

Or else, she wouldn’t have waited until Grandpa Jian had finished talking to come in and resolve the dispute.

Grandma Jian and Grandpa Jian have supported and loved each other for a long time. They knew a lot about each other and their temperaments.

For small things, she could do what she wanted and he would listen to her.

However, on serious matters, whatever Grandpa Jian said would be stuck to.

If she wasn’t tactful, they wouldn’t have remained together for this long.''',

      '''Grandma Jian went up and comforted Jian Yiling again, “Okay, good girl. If you do something wrong, admit it, but never do it again! If someone makes you angry again, don’t be so impulsive. If you don’t know what to do, talk to grandma.”

Grandma Jian consistently defended her granddaughter despite knowing that she was in the wrong.

She defended the Jian family, and especially Jian Yiling.

Jian Yiling and Jian Shuxing stayed back at the Old Jian Residence for dinner.

After the meal, everyone sat together and sipped tea.

At this time, Grandpa Jian asked about a recent event that was noteworthy that occurred in Hengyuan city.

“I heard that that man from Beijing has come to Hengyuan City?”

Although Grandpa Jian wasn’t clear with his words, Jian Shuxing knew exactly who he was talking about. There were only a few people who were worthy to be mentioned by Grandpa Jian.

“Yes, he’s here,” Jian Shuxing had already confirmed the news.

The news was deliberately released by the Zhai family. It was done so that everyone in Hengyuan City would keep watch of this man.

“Then you should pay attention to it. Try to keep some distance from him. That man from the Zhai family is most troublesome. If something were to happen, it will be difficult to deal with.” Even Grandpa Jian was worried about this matter.

“Don’t worry dad. I know.” Jian Shuxing said as he knew what was going on, “But Dad, I don’t understand why the Zhai family is so nervous. Even though he is the only child of the Zhai family, he is an adult already. They shouldn’t be...”

Jian Shuxing was rather confused on how the Zhai family treated their child.

Grandpa Jian sighed, “This Master Sheng is not only the only child of the Zhai family. He also has a weak heart from birth. If something happens, he will die. His life was protected by the Zhai family from birth till now.”

This information was revealed to Grandpa Jian by a good friend in Beijing. This wasn’t a secret in Beijing.

Jian Shuxing continued, “I don’t know what relationship Master Sheng has with the Tianxing Group. I don’t understand why he came all the way to Hengyuan City. I not only received the news from the Zhai family in Beijing, but I also received news from the Tianxing Group.”

Grandpa Jian also knew the reason for that. “Tianxing Group’s leader is no other than the second master of the Zhai family. He is the uncle of Master Sheng. In his early years, this second master was a ruthless character. He couldn’t be disciplined and constantly caused trouble. In fact, he made quite of few enemies. When one of his enemies came to find him, his older brother died trying to save him. And thus, this caused him to completely correct his former misdeeds. He feels as though he owes his elder brother and so all these years, he hasn’t married. Other than work, he takes care of his nephew. He has even announced to the public that his business empire is going to be left to his nephew.”

Most people didn’t know the reason behind all this. Grandpa Jian had only heard from his former friend.

It was because the second Master of the Zhai family felt that he owed his brother and his family, he never mentioned that he was from the Zhai family when he initially entered the business world. Everyone only knew that his surname was Zhai.

“I didn’t expect the Tianxing Group to have such a relationship with the Zhai family.”

This was indeed quite shocking. The Jian family’s background or strength could not be compared to the Tianxing Group nor the Zhai family.

Jian Yiling held her teacup and took small sips whilst she listened to her father and grandpa talk.

Beijing and the surname was Sheng.

A name suddenly popped up in Jian Yiling’s mind.

It was him! The villain of this book! He was the biggest threat to the male lead after he returned to Beijing!''',

      '''“All of you, this is your last awakening ceremony. If you guys still fail to awaken, you will have to spend the rest of your lives as ordinary humans. You all might find this somewhat regretful, but you guys will also be far away from the vast majority of dangers, so this might not be a bad thing…”

A voice entered Lu Yuan’s ears, bringing him back to reality from his illusions.

As a result, his body violently shook and he was shocked awake.

Lu Yuan then lifted his head and glanced at the surroundings with bewilderment in his eyes.

Right now, he was inside a classroom that was packed full of students, roughly around forty of them.

On the rostrum, a teacher over 50 years old was currently speaking.

(...This place is?)

Lu Yuan was shocked in his heart.

(Am I not dead?)

Originally, Lu Yuan was a corporate drone that ‘enjoyed’ the 996 working schedule*. Sometimes, he could even get to enjoy the 007 working schedule*.

Right now, the rat race was becoming increasingly competitive. If he didn’t work overtime, it was as though he would let down the entire world.

And due to staying up all night too much, eating packed food daily, and having unhealthy work and life balance, he eventually got cancer.

After the diagnosis was confirmed, Lu Yuan actually didn’t feel too many fluctuations in his heart.

......

Wasn’t life something that was supposed to give you a ‘surprise’ after you thought that you had been through and experienced enough shit?

Although this ‘surprise’ was very huge, he had grown somewhat numb with his life.

When the diagnosis was confirmed, the cancer was already in its late stages. Hence, to reduce his family’s financial burden as well as his pain, after he had deleted many of his study data with tears in his eyes, Lu Yuan ultimately chose to end his life.

Although escaping was very disgraceful, Lu Yuan felt that it was quite useful.

He still had a younger brother at home, so Lu Yuan didn’t have to worry that no one would take care of his parents. Hence, he was quite serene when he ended his life.

But probably, his parents would feel very hurt, right?

Lu Yuan’s consciousness trembled for an instant, and he returned to reality after that.

Since that was the case, a question appeared in his mind.

(Who am I?)

(Where am I?)

The words spoken by the teacher could be understood individually when Lu Yuan heard them. But when the words were joined together, he couldn’t understand what they meant.

(Awakening?)

(What awakening?)

At this moment, Lu Yuan’s brain swelled, as much information entered his mind.

The confusion in his eyes gradually faded and became much clearer than before.

So, he had arrived in another world and become another young man that was also named Lu Yuan.

In this world, everyone would have a chance to awaken during the three adolescent years, from age 16 to age 18.

If they managed to awaken successfully, they would be able to activate their genetic chain and become mystical gene fighters. Moreover, they could then enter a place named ‘Land of Origins’ to adventure and explore, obtaining magical treasures and powerful strength.

As Lu Yuan wasn’t an awakener, his understanding of the Land of Origins and awakeners wasn’t much, and he had limited information on them.

In this world, he was an orphan. When he was very young, he became the sole survivor of his family. in an unfortunate mutation incident. It was only under the child support provided by the empire that he was able to survive and grow up.

When he recalled that incident that was in the depths of his brain, Lu Yuan’s pupils violently narrowed and his body shuddered.

This was his body’s instinct when in terror.

This year, Lu Yuan was already 18 years old. If he could awaken and activate his genetic chain, he would be able to head to a gene fighter academy in the future.

If he couldn’t awaken, he could choose to take the test and join an ordinary university. Naturally, the empire would no longer be responsible for his living expenses and school fees.

After all, the empire’s child support would only last until one became an adult at 18 years old.

Strangely, the memory of this original body vanished before this lesson started. At the end of the memory, his body fell onto the table as he lost consciousness.

It seemed that this original body somehow died?

Because the original body’s personality was too antisocial, he didn’t even have a single friend in class. Even after the lesson started, no one discovered that he had died. This lasted until Lu Yuan transmigrated here.

This made Lu Yuan feel somewhat astonished.

From the memory of this original body, it seemed that due to the mutation incident, in addition to losing his parents, his personality became extremely anti-social. However, his body was still very healthy.

So, why would he suffer a sudden death?

He didn’t stay up through the night at all, right?

Lu Yuan pondered and felt that it might be due to the sequela from the mutation incident. After all, in this world, mutation was the most difficult thing to understand. It wouldn’t be strange if anything happened.

Lu Yuan didn’t continue to probe.

To him, being able to start all over again was something worthy of celebration.

Since he was here, he should just live his new life with peace of mind.

He just hoped that this new life wouldn’t be too involuted, as he was really worried he might not be able to handle it.

“Alright, come onto the stage if your name is called. We’ll start the awakening ceremony. Wang Yi.”

The words spoken by the teacher pulled Lu Yuan back from his thoughts. After that, he lifted his head and glanced at the rostrum as a hint of anticipation appeared in his eyes.

Awakening.

In the past, he had also read novels before, so he naturally thirsted for supernatural powers like these.

The original body had failed the past two times. Hence, Lu Yuan could only hope that he would be able to succeed this time.

The guy named Wang Yi went onto the stage, his face filled with nervousness as he stared at the teacher.

“Don’t be nervous. You’ve tried awakening twice before, so you should know what to do, right? Place your hand on the awakening crystal and use your heart to sense your existence.”

Wang Yi nodded and directly placed his hand on a crystal ball on the desk. After that, he closed his eyes.

The air turned heavy as the atmosphere fell silent.

A short while later, the teacher glanced at his pocket watch and spoke in a dull manner.

“Alright, it has been one minute. There are no reactions from the awakening crystal, so you have failed the awakening. You can go down now.”

When Wang Yi heard this, his eyes turned red. After that, he walked back in disappointment.

The atmosphere in the class turned somewhat bleak.

The teacher swept his gaze over everyone and spoke.

“There’s only a 10% chance for ordinary people to awaken, and the probability becomes lower time after time. If one fails the first two times, the rate of success for their third attempt will be extremely low. Don’t harbor too much hope so you can avoid being disappointed if you fail.”

Upon hearing this, the atmosphere grew even heavier and more restrained.

At this moment, Lu Yuan couldn’t help but praise this guy silently. This teacher was truly the king of chilling the atmosphere.

After hearing this, even his heart state grew colder by a great deal.

Didn’t that mean that he would fail his awakening?

However, wasn’t there something wrong here?

According to novels, weren’t people who transmigrated the main characters?

If he didn’t awaken, wouldn’t this world lose an extremely powerful gene fighter?

Also, in the future when they had to deal with mutation attacks, the pillars of humanity against the outsiders would be lacking by one.

This was a loss that humanity couldn’t afford to have!

“Next, Li Xi.”

…

The awakening ceremony continued.

Just like what the teacher had said, the third attempt at awakening had an extremely low probability of success.

Half an hour later, 30 students had finished the ceremony, but not a single one awakened successfully.

Lu Yuan’s heart also continued to sink unceasingly.

“Lu Yuan.”

When the teacher called Lu Yuan’s name, for a time, everyone in the class turned and gazed over.

Lu Yuan was someone they treated as non-existent. As he had no good friends who could cheer and encourage him, everyone merely watched him in silence.

Also, the teacher’s attitude toward him was as indifferent as how he treated the other students. He maintained a poker face continuously.

Lu Yuan grumbled in his heart. Where was the special treatment accorded to the main characters?

If things developed in the usual way, wouldn’t there be many people showing care and concern for him or someone jumping out to mock him?

But why were their reactions so calm and indifferent?

Was this logical?

(Could it be that I’m not the main character?)

Lu Yuan arrived before the desk and the teacher repeated his earlier words again.

“Place your hand on the crystal ball and use your heart to sense your existence. Don’t be too nervous.”

Lu Yuan nodded and placed his hand on the awakening crystal.

The surface of the awakening crystal was very cool. It felt very comfortable to touch it.

Closing his eyes, Lu Yuan followed his teacher’s instruction to sense his existence.

After that, he felt a stretch of darkness before his eyes.

Time flowed silently as Lu Yuan’s heart gradually grew increasingly nervous and uneasy. He didn’t sense anything at all.

(Could it be that I really cannot awaken? This world isn’t safe. It’s always better to have some strength than none.)

Just when Lu Yuan’s heart was saddled with unease, a dot of blue light manifested in the darkness.

In the next instant, a blue-colored translucent cube appeared in the darkness and began to make irregular rotating movements.

At that moment, the darkness shattered and white mist shrouded his perception.

A gigantic double-helix light pillar stood tall and imposingly in the white mist. There was a white-colored base below it, and the top of the pillar was covered by the mist.

After the double-helix light pillar appeared, the blue cube seemed to be attracted by it. It moved near to the light pillar and began to rotate around it.

Genetic chain!

Lu Yuan’s heart was filled with surprise.

(Have I awakened? As expected, I’m indeed the mighty me! But what is this cube?)

Although his understanding of gene fighters wasn’t much, he still knew some basic knowledge about awakening.

He had never heard that a cube would appear when someone awakened.

Lu Yuan then stared at the cube. At the next instant, as though he was possessed by instinct, he understood the information about the blue cube.

The function of this cube was very simple and also excessively ridiculous.

Evolution.

It was said that gene fighters could engrave and record the genes of monsters and ferocious beasts in the Land of Origins to obtain genetic battle techniques. For example, the swimming ability of fishes and the flight ability of birds. It was a type of ability that was engraved and recorded in the genes.

Whenever gene fighters leveled up, a new blank genetic chain would appear, giving them a chance to engrave and record new genes.

However, the gene that was engraved and recorded in the blank genetic chain would be something fixed; there wouldn’t be any way to continue upgrading it. Low-grade genes wouldn’t bring about too much improvement, while high-grade genes might even counter-devour the host if the host wasn’t cautious enough when they engraved and recorded it.

So, one had to be exceptionally careful when they chose the genes. Every time they recorded and engraved a genetic battle technique, they had to ensure that the new technique was something beneficial to their existing ones.

On the other hand, this cube could actually continue evolving the genes after they had been engraved and recorded. This was relatively equal to having limitless potential. Even if the gene he engraved and recorded was the weakest and most common gene, it could gradually evolve to its ultimate peak!

This represented limitless potential and boundless possibilities!

      '''Lu Yuan’s heart pounded. This blue cube was simply too strong.

Limitless evolution!

As long as he had time, he could definitely grow to a stage that shocked and terrified everyone.

The strongest in humanity?

The strongest in the universe?

There was hope for everything!

However, what sort of thing was this cube exactly? Why would it appear during his awakening?

Just when Lu Yuan was pondering, his left wrist suddenly felt a slight piercing pain.

After that, he opened his eyes and discovered that the awakening crystal was currently emitting a white glow. Also, golden lines were moving around his left wrist, and they eventually formed the shape of a golden ring.

Gene battle tattoo.

This was the symbol of every awakener.

This was also the ‘key’ to entering the Land of Origins.

The manifestation of the gene battle tattoo also proved that Lu Yuan had successfully awakened as a gene fighter.

......

“Gene battle tattoo?! Lu Yuan, you’ve awakened!”

His teacher’s shocked voice rang out.

The students below were also in an uproar, filled with shock.

“Lu Yuan actually awakened!”

“He is usually so quiet and reticent, to think that he could actually awaken?”

“Hmph…so what if he has awakened? Things are so dangerous for gene fighters, maybe some accidents might happen to him.”

The gazes of the students looking at Lu Yuan were filled with envy and jealousy. Some girls even looked at Lu Yuan with a strange light in their eyes.

Honestly speaking, Lu Yuan was relatively handsome. It was just that his personality was more to the gloomy and anti-social side. Also, due to him experiencing the mutation incident, no one dared to get close to him.

But now that he had awakened, Lu Yuan’s attractiveness immediately rose by a few levels, causing some young girls to feel their desires stirring.

As humanity’s high-end combat force, gene fighters could be considered to have a very high status.

After hearing the discussions of the students below, he completely didn’t take their words to heart.

In truth, not many people would really hope that you could lead a better life than them.

Anyway, Lu Yuan had long since passed the age of arguing. It was good as long as he could do his own things.

After Lu Yuan awakened, the originally strict face of the teacher finally revealed a smile.

He looked at Lu Yuan and gently spoke.

“Student Lu Yuan, congratulations. In the future, you will be a gene fighter. There are still two months more before the college entrance examinations, so work hard and do your best to enter gene fighter academies that rank near the top. This will be beneficial to your future…Oh right, you have just awakened. You can head to the Gene Fighter Association for registration. After you register yourself, you will be able to claim \$5,000 every month as subsidies.”

Upon hearing this, Lu Yuan was pleasantly surprised.

\$5000?!

Although he received the empire’s child support, he only got \$800 every month, and this was only sufficient for the most basic living expenses.

Naturally, his school fees and school-related sundries were free of charge.

In comparison, students that graduated from an ordinary university would earn around \$3,000 per month.

But now, Lu Yuan could get \$5,000 per month even without doing anything? He suddenly felt an illusion as though he had arrived at the peak of life.

After all, who wouldn’t like free money?

However, Lu Yuan soon regained his senses.

He was someone destined to become the strongest man in the universe! How could he be satisfied by something so minor?

Unless they gave him \$10,000 every month!

Lu Yuan nodded and smiled. “Understood. Many thanks for teacher’s reminder.”

Lu Yuan didn’t feel surprised by the change in his teacher’s attitude.

He heard that awakeners were counted as part of a teacher’s KPI, and there would be a huge monetary reward for the teachers as well.

At this moment, the teacher glanced at the students below and smiled.

“Let us congratulate student Lu Yuan for awakening successfully.”

Regardless of whether the students below were willing or not, all of them applauded alongside the teacher.

After that, the teacher smiled and nodded before looking at Lu Yuan.

“Alright, you can head down.”

Under the gazes of everyone, Lu Yuan returned to his seat.

“The awakening ceremony will continue. Next, Wang Ming.”

The ceremony continued but Lu Yuan paid no attention to that.

Right now, he was checking out the gene battle tattoo. He could sense that this gene battle tattoo seemed to be a type of switch.

Also, he could control the opening and closing of the switch via his will.

He had a hunch that after turning on the switch, he should be able to enter the legendary Land of Origins.

It was just that right now, Lu Yuan still didn’t have much understanding of the Land of Origins. Before entering, he had to make the appropriate preparations.

As of now, there were two more months before he had to participate in the college entrance examinations.

The examination for gene fighters would surely be different compared to the normal one.

Compared to peers who awakened at 16 years old, he was already slower by two years. It wasn’t going to be simple for him to catch up and get into a good school in just two months.

Fortunately, he had the cube that could limitlessly evolve genes. He felt that he still had hope.

Lu Yuan, who had experienced life in university in his previous life, naturally understood how important a good university was to one’s life. It was a better platform that could allow your future path to be smoother.

No matter what, he had to do his utmost and try to enter the best gene fighter academy.

After he returned, he would first understand more information about the Land of Origins before working hard.

Anyway, the term ‘evolution cube’ was something coined by Lu Yuan.

He felt that it was very pleasant sounding to the ears and very fitting.

…

After Lu Yuan awakened, the remaining students were filled with more anticipation. Maybe, they also had a chance of awakening successfully?

However, the reality was cruel.

All the way until the last student had completed the ceremony, only Lu Yuan, among the 41 students in the class, had succeeded in awakening as a gene fighter.

After the awakening ceremony concluded, the teacher put the crystal ball away. Looking at the disappointed students, he spoke.

“Not being able to awaken is very normal. Since you cannot become a gene fighter, you should calm yourself down and study properly to enter a good university. This is your responsibility for your own future.”

Lu Yuan didn’t know if these students could understand the teacher’s words. As for him, he had a sense of deja vu from his previous life before he had taken the college entrance examinations.

Sadly, the number of students in his previous life who understood these words was similarly not a lot. When they finally understood, things were already too late.

With regard to their futures, all immature boys would have a sense of misguided confidence. They would feel that they were the main characters of their time. As long as they entered society, they would definitely become a CEO and marry a fair-skinned, beautiful young miss from a rich family as they climbed to the peak of their lives.

However, in the end, the vast majority became salary workers.

That’s right, Lu Yuan was one of these people.

For a time, Lu Yuan actually somewhat missed the previous him with a misguided sense of self-confidence.

Where exactly did the sense of misguided confidence come from back then?

It was different compared to the current him. He was much more realistic now.

(Mn, as expected of me!)

The teacher left after speaking, and only after that did the students in the class group together in small teams of twos and threes. Then they slammed their tables and grumbled.

“I actually didn’t awaken! I thought that I would be able to awaken for sure this time around!”

“Ai...in the future, we can only study hard and be ordinary people.”

“It seems like I can only return and inherit my family business. Luckily, my family owns a small company. At the very least, I don’t have to worry about food and clothing.”

“...livestock!”

“…”

When the various students were conversing, they would inadvertently cast glances over at Lu Yuan occasionally.

After all, he was the only one who had awakened in their class.

At this moment, a female student who was relatively pretty stood up and walked toward Lu Yuan’s desk. After that, she smiled at him and spoke.

“Student Lu Yuan, I think our homes are quite close to each other. Do you want to go back together later?”

Lu Yuan glanced at her and shook his head before calmly replying, “Nope. I’m used to being alone.”

The girl’s smile stiffened. She then laughed dryly and nodded. “Oh.”

After that, she turned around and departed.

The other girls who were brimming with desire also felt their desires being extinguished when they saw this. They had no choice but to discard their plans.

Lu Yuan also heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.

Although his personality was somewhat different from before, he wasn’t that extremely anti-social.

However, he truly had nothing much to talk about to students who were destined not to walk with him in the future.

His original body had never conversed with any of them through the three years in high school. Hence, there was naturally no need to have any interactions right now.

The commotion Lu Yuan caused with his awakening faded away quickly.

Even though he was a gene fighter, he still had to attend culture classes. Gene fighters were not illiterate after all, and in addition, studying more in school could improve one’s thought process and logical thinking ability.

During the afternoon after school ended, Lu Yuan left the school and decided to walk to the Gene Fighter Association.

Earlier, he had checked the map. The Gene Fighter Association was very far from the school, and he needed to walk over an hour before he could reach that place.

As to why he didn’t want to take a car?

Other than being poor, what other reasons could there be?

Although Lu Yuan had seen the appearance of this city through the memories of this body, now that he walked on the streets and glanced at the surroundings, he still felt a sense of surrealism.

There were high-rise buildings all around. Neon lights were flashing and floating cars were traversing through the air. Moreover, there was a gigantic screen showing advertisements, and beautiful female celebrities could be seen dancing and singing as they smiled beautifully.

There were many people on the streets. Some even had mechanical limbs and Lu Yuan could see robots.

At this moment, Lu Yuan’s heart was filled with shock. It was as though he had arrived in the future.''',

Xili City, Gene Fighter Association Southern District Branch.

It was an extremely conspicuous building in this flourishing and bustling area.

The building was constructed from black stones, and its width was over 200 meters. Before the main door, there were two statues of warriors roughly fifty meters tall standing at the center. They held long swords that intersected in the air, and the door was underneath that intersection.

The dressing of the people entering and exiting the door was also quite different from ordinary people.

Some wore armor, some wore robes, some carried swords, and there were even some people with tails. Lu Yuan somewhat suspected that these people weren’t humans. Could humans actually grow a tail?

However, it seemed that everyone possessed a powerful aura.

In this place, Lu Yuan was like a lamb that had fallen into a pack of wolves.

He drew in a deep breath and entered the door.

After passing through the door and arriving at a lounge, Lu Yuan discovered the information counter in the center of the lounge at first glance.

He then carefully avoided all the gene fighters who strode around vigorously as he went to the information counter.

The young woman at the information counter smiled amiably and looked at Lu Yuan.

“Hello, do you have anything you need my help with?”

......

“I just awakened and I want to register.”

The young lady pointed to the right. “The registration spot is over there…Xiao Ai, bring this Mister over.”

After the young lady spoke, a white-colored robot about 1.6 meters tall walked out. It then spoke in a melodious and vivacious loli-voice.

“Mister, please come with me. Xiao Ai will bring you to the registration spot for gene fighters.”

After the robot Xiao Ai finished speaking, it turned and walked away. Lu Yuan hurriedly followed it.

When the gene fighters saw the robot Xiao Ai, they all made way for it. Lu Yuan followed it smoothly, so there was no longer a need for him to avoid the crowd. Not long later, they arrived at a room on the right of the lounge.

This room was roughly about two hundred square meters. There were some chairs in the center of the room and a row of windows on the side facing the entrance. There, some staff could be seen currently doing the registration.

Lu Yuan swiftly swept his gaze through the room.

Over twenty people seated on the chairs placed in the center of the room. Their faces were all immature and looked roughly the same age as Lu Yuan. In fact, they might be even younger than him.

Lu Yuan knew that these people were probably the same as him. They must have just awakened.

After the robot Xiao Ai brought Lu Yuan to the room, her loli-like voice rang out once more.

“Mister, this is the registration spot. You can get a ticket from the ticketing machine and wait for your number to be called.”

Xiao Ai pointed to a ticketing machine at the side.

After that, Lu Yuan walked over and got a ticket. It was numbered B12.

He glanced at the B-screen window and the number now was B08. He had to wait a little while more.

He then went to a corner and sat down as he waited quietly.

Roughly about half an hour later, the announcement rang out and Lu Yuan’s number was called.

After that, Lu Yuan went to the designated booth and sat down. There was a skinny young woman within.

She smiled at Lu Yuan.

“Hello, are you here to complete the registration for gene fighters?”

“Yes.”

“Please give me the ticket. After that, we will need to scan your fingerprints and your pupils.”

Lu Yuan passed the ticket to her and after that, he followed her instructions and allowed her to scan his fingerprints and pupils.

The young lady cast a glance at the screen beside her and smiled.

“A citizen of the empire, your identity number is XL139205253232. Your name is Lu Yuan. Please verify the information and check if it’s correct.”

A screen also appeared before Lu Yuan’s eyes. Lu Yuan’s photo, ID number, and name could be seen on it.

Lu Yuan glanced at them before nodding to confirm the details.

“Please show your gene battle tattoo.”

Lu Yuan lifted his left wrist and revealed the golden patterns on it.

After that, the young lady took out a black apparatus and placed it on the golden tattoo. Very soon, a sound rang out as the black apparatus flashed with green light.

She smiled and spoke.

“Your gene battle tattoo has been confirmed. Mister Lu Yuan, congratulations on becoming a gene fighter. May your martial destiny be a prosperous one, fighting for the existence of humanity.”

“Many thanks!”

The young lady then continued with her work before she spoke.

“The registration is completed. You have just awakened and can now be considered a probational gene fighter. You will also receive 5,000 red maple coins as the empire’s stipend monthly, and the stipend this month has been transferred to your personal account. Also, I’ve activated the authority for you to log in to the battleweb. Your account number is your ID number and the preset password is 666666. You can browse the battleweb to check for information related to gene fighters. The Empire has also prepared free copies of Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique, Military Fist, and Military Swordplay for newly awakened people. They have been sent to your battleweb email. Please remember to check and read through them after you return.”

The young lady spoke a lot. After that, she lifted her head and looked at Lu Yuan as she smiled.

“Might I ask if you still have any other questions?”

Lu Yuan was a little startled after he finished listening seriously.

He quickly took out his mobile phone for a look and saw the message that \$5,000 had been transferred into his account.

Right now, his savings reached \$5,035. This was simply a matter worthy of celebration!

As for the free Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique and whatnot, Lu Yuan still didn’t have much understanding of them.

He planned to look more in-depth into these after he returned.

Upon thinking of this, his desire to return home surged. He smiled radiantly.

“Nope. Thanks!”

“No need to be polite. If you don’t have any other questions, could you please give a rating for my service?”

Lu Yuan naturally gave her a five-star evaluation.

After that, Lu Yuan impatiently left the Gene Fighter Association.

Now that he had money, Lu Yuan decided to call for a taxi after he left the building.

Not a few seconds later, a floating car with no one inside stopped before Lu Yuan.

The science and technology of this world were much more advanced compared to Lu Yuan’s previous world.

The technology of full self-automated driving, A.I. robotics, and even floating vehicles were already matured.

According to Lu Yuan’s understanding, all these were knowledge obtained by gene fighters from the Land of Origins.

One could very well imagine how many treasures there were in the Land of Origins.

Unable to contain his excitement, he directly went into the car and prepared to head home.

Not long later, the floating car arrived at a somewhat tattered-looking district from the brightly-lit district he was in.

Bang, bang, bang!!

While in the car, Lu Yuan could faintly hear gunshots from a distance.

His expression remained unchanged and remained normal.

Because there was a limit to what he could spend on his living expenses, Lu Yuan’s home was located in the slums. Since that was the case, the public security here wasn’t that good and gunfights would happen occasionally.

After all, mutation incidents existed in this world, so ferocious beasts would occasionally invade the cities. This was why ordinary humans were not prohibited from carrying weapons.

This also caused districts with bad public security to be rife with gangs and crimes.

Actually, the district Lu Yuan lived in could be considered pretty good already. After all, he heard that those districts had people going missing every day.

Very soon, the floating car stopped outside Lu Yuan’s neighborhood. Lu Yuan got down and hurriedly entered.

After that, he had to carefully sidestep a few drunkards and politely refuse the prostitutes who were out soliciting before he could reach his room.

It was a small room of about 20 square meters with only a bed, a study desk, and a simple toilet.

It was to be expected as the rental here was very cheap, only costing \$200 per month.

Only after returning to his room did Lu Yuan let out a breath he was holding in.

Every time he returned home, he was afraid that a stray bullet might blow his head out.

In the past, he only felt like this from looking through the memories of the original body. But now that he had personally experienced it, Lu Yuan’s heart was pounding in fear.

He felt that he had been pacing between the edge of life and death.

(Wait a minute…)

(This big bro, I, seemed to be rich now?)

His eyes brightened as he suddenly thought of this.

(I will go and view some properties tomorrow. I’ll move away from this hell-like place!)

If not, he was afraid he might be killed by gunshots before he became a major character.

That would then truly be the greatest loss in the history of humanity alright?!

After a while, he no longer thought about this. He turned on the ancient-looking notebook on his desk and logged in to the gene fighter website, or the battleweb for short.

He inputted the address and opened the webpage before entering his ID and password.

“My identification number…and 666666…I’ve managed to log in!”

The first thing he did after logging in was to change his password. After that, he decided to use a nickname.

He had wanted to use the nickname ‘Fated Person’. But in the end, he discovered that this name was already used.

He then tried out a few other nicknames, but those already existed as well.

Ultimately, Lu Yuan decided to choose ‘Helper’, a nickname that was filled with the willingness to help out.

This made Lu Yuan realize that no matter which world he was in, choosing a name was always the most troublesome thing.

After changing his nickname and password, Lu Yuan discovered that he had gotten an email.

He opened up the email for a look and there were three pieces of data inside.

Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique.

Military Fist.

Military Swordplay.''',

      'MY GENES CAN EVOLVE LIMITLESSLY',
      '''Lu Yuan opened the folder with the title ‘Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique’.

There were only four pages inside.

However, the very first sentence was a warning written in blood-red color.

“The [Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique] is the official property of the Red Maple Empire, and it’s forbidden for genetic fighters to privately teach others about this technique. Those who violate the rule will be punished by the death sentence!”

Lu Yuan’s pupils involuntarily narrowed when he saw this.

(It’s actually so strict? Seems that this is very valuable.)

Lu Yuan then hurriedly continued reading.

The content of the Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique was very simple. There was only an explanation about basic knowledge of spirit qi and how to absorb spirit qi.

Spirit qi was a type of omnipotent energy that existed everywhere in the universe, and only gene fighters who had activated their gene chains could absorb and use it.

Through tempering their bodies and minds, gene fighters would be able to produce spirit qi and also absorb spirit qi from the outside world.

Spirit qi could refine the genetic chain, which in turn nourished and strengthened the body and spirit.

When an awakened genetic chain was completely refined by spirit qi, it would be able to activate higher-grade genetic chains by employing special methods.

This was also a way for gene fighters to improve themselves.

......

Lu Yuan was enlightened. Only with spirit qi could a gene fighter’s power be completely unleashed. With it, he could improve himself unceasingly.

No wonder there would be a warning written in blood-red.

Only gene fighters who had finished registering themselves would be able to obtain the spirit qi guiding technique gifted by the authorities. Since that was the case, gene fighters who didn’t register themselves naturally wouldn’t be able to have something like this.

Usually, the majority of gene fighters who didn’t register themselves were characters that preferred staying out of sight.

Without the Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique, refining genetic chains would become extremely difficult for these people.

It could be considered that Lu Yuan understood the meaning of the warning.

Naturally, such a method wouldn’t be able to prevent some people from taking a risk out of desperation.

At this moment, Lu Yuan solemnly memorized the content of the Spirit Qi Guiding Technique as he planned to cultivate it properly later on.

After that, Lu Yuan looked at the other two pieces of data.

The military fist and military swordplay were basic physical training techniques used by the Red Maple Empire.

They were a fist art and sword art.

If one were to practice these two physical training techniques for a long period, they would be able to improve their physical strength and even their mental strength. In addition, these were killing techniques that could be used for practical combat.

There were videos on the Military Fist and Military Swordplay. A middle-aged man with a cold demeanor clad in a military uniform was teaching the two techniques.

The guidance was very detailed, and text was also provided for explanation. Hence, Lu Yuan didn’t feel that they were difficult to learn.

He planned to properly practice these two physical training techniques later.

After properly saving the data in the folders, Lu Yuan started to surf the battleweb.

There were many segments on the battleweb: the trading segment, combat segment, mission segment, etc.

The first page consisted of some major news regarding the circle of gene fighters.

“Shocking news! The Icesnow Princess Si Tingxue who disappeared for half a year actually has broken through to the Battle Master level!”

“The Mystic Nine Battle King has become the sixth Battle King-level expert of the Great Revelation Planet’s humans that successfully barges into the Great Rock Secret Realm!”

“…”

Lu Yuan browsed through them quickly and finally found the segment containing information on the Land of Origins.

There were several forum posts about the Land of Origins in this segment.

Many of the posts required the user to pay a fee before they could gain entry, but some provided information for free.

The free information posts were usually those issued by the officials, which gave some basic information on the Land of Origins.

And for Lu Yuan who planned to enter the Land of Origins, he precisely lacked such information.

He clicked into a forum post.

[What preparation work do you need to do if you are entering the Land of Origins for the first time?]

“For the majority of awakened gene fighters, they would have guidance from their elders before they entered the Land of Origins. For people like them, the information here is useless to them. The information in this post is targeted at newbies who don’t have gene fighter elders to guide them. If you are a newbie, please seriously read on as this will help you a lot.

“First point, let’s talk about the first time you ‘guide’ spirit qi. Before entering the Land of Origins, you have to absorb your first portion of spirit qi. Because only by possessing spirit qi will you be able to open up the space within your battle gene tattoo. Although the excavated space of probational gene fighters is very small, it can still allow you to bring some things with you. In the future, you can only depend on this space to bring out your gains from the Land of Origins. This is very important.

“Second point, it’s about the choice of items that you should bring when you enter the Land of Origins for the first time. Firstly, scientific weapons produced in the outside world are useless in the Land of Origins. So, you don’t have to think about using gauss guns or high-energy explosive bombs. If you are a newbie that has a certain amount of capital, we recommend you to purchase some good genetic armaments. This will allow you to be stronger compared to others of the same level, so you will have a lead at the starting line. If you don’t have enough money to purchase the armaments, you can only bring some necessities and these necessities are listed below…

“Third point, as newbies, you guys must know that you can only enter the Land of Origins for 24 hours for the first time. Every second of these 24 hours is extremely precious because you can obtain spirit crystals when you kill the monsters in the Land of Origins and use the crystals to improve your cultivation. As long as you can leave the Land of Origins alive, you will be able to bring your harvests back to reality. To gene fighters, this is the only shortcut to getting stronger. Also, the spirit crystals are merely items of the lowest value in the Land of Origins. When the monsters die, they have a small chance of dropping genetic armaments, extraordinary genes, precious items, etc. All these are extremely valuable. When you are adventuring in the Land of Origins, you might even come across ruins and might be able to obtain technology or transcendent knowledge from it. The value of these things is unimaginable, and it’s the best opportunity for you to earn your first pot of gold. So, please use these 24 hours properly.

“Fourth point, if you have friends you can trust enough, you guys can adventure together and make use of the gene battle tattoo to establish an alliance. As to how spoils will be distributed, this naturally means equal distribution, so conflict and fights can be avoided. Moreover, other than humans in the initial city, there will be other races too. Please maintain your vigilance toward these other races!

“Fifth point, newly awakened newbies will have anchor points in their gene battle tattoos. These anchor points will also determine the initial city you will arrive at in the Land of Origins. As everyone knows, all the initial cities in the Land of Origins have existed long ago, and it’s impossible for us to monopolize them. We, humans from the Great Revelation Planet, have four initial cities we will arrive at. They are separately known as Storm City, Bone City, Sandstone City, and Bloodsecret Castle. Next, I will introduce the advantages and disadvantages of these four initial cities…”

The text was at least 10,000 words long. After seriously reading them all, Lu Yuan finally could be considered to have a general understanding of the Land of Origins.

The Land of Origins was a magical place that possessed boundless treasures.

In the Land of Origins, one would only be able to bring back their gains if they left safely.

If they died, they would lose everything.

In fact, death would injure their mental states, and they had to wait for a certain amount of time to pass before they could enter the Land of Origins again.

This influence was too great.

There were two methods if one wanted to exit the Land of Origins.

The first was to wait for the remaining time to end, and the second was to make use of an escape tool to flee the Land of Origins. Both methods could allow one to bring their gains out.

However, escape tools were very precious. Lu Yuan’s face had the word poverty ‘written’ on it, so how could he afford to buy one?

Let alone escape tools, Lu Yuan couldn’t even afford to buy genetic armaments.

He had checked the trading area earlier. Even the lowest-grade genetic armaments cost \$10,000 at the very least.

Lu Yuan rubbed his forehead.

(Why am I so poor?)

(Could it be that I still have to bust my liver to earn money after coming to this world?)

(There must be a problem somewhere!)

Lu Yuan was somewhat reluctant to believe in this truth.

After that, he checked a few more forum posts and finally had a general understanding of the preparation work he had to do before venturing into the Land of Origins. He also finished his planning.

Firstly, he had to cultivate the spirit qi guiding technique, absorbing spirit qi and opening up the gene battle tattoo space.

Secondly, he had to shop for necessities tomorrow and buy an alloy weapon he felt comfortable with. Since he couldn’t afford genetic armaments, he would have to make do with common alloy weapons.

Thirdly, if he had the time to do so, he would practice the Military Fist and Military Swordplay to enhance his personal strength. It was because he didn’t want to ‘die’ the first time he entered. That would be too hurtful.

After confirming the steps he had to take, Lu Yuan shut the computer down. He then went to his bed and sat cross-legged, planning to breathe in spirit qi.

“Mn…according to the Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique, I have to first close my eyes and empty my mind, allowing myself to be in a drowsy and vacant state. I should be able to sense spirit qi after that.”

Lu Yuan recalled the information as he closed his eyes.

However, the moment Lu Yuan closed his eyes, he immediately sensed numerous white dots of light around him. These white dots of light all got close to Lu Yuan, ‘dancing’ around him as though they were in a jubilant manner.

Lu Yuan, “???”

He was somewhat astonished.

(Spirit qi?!)

(Why is there so much?!)

(Wrong, I haven’t emptied my mind yet. Why would I already be able to sense spirit qi?)

(Why is this somewhat different from the introduction?)''',

      'MY GENES CAN EVOLVE LIMITLESSLY',
      '''Lu Yuan was somewhat astonished as he looked at the floating and dancing spirit qi particles in his consciousness. After falling silent, he cautiously used the method described in the Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique to absorb the spirit qi particles.

The moment he breathed in, all the spirit qi particles seemed to be attracted by a magnet. They lunged toward Lu Yuan with flying speed and melded into his body.

In his consciousness, the spirit qi particles passed through the white mist and fused with the double helix genetic chain.

Originally, the light emitted by the double helix genetic chain was dimmer. But gradually, from the bottommost part, its glow began to intensify.

As the genetic chain became increasingly brighter, Lu Yuan felt his body growing warm. There seemed to be some swelling in his glabella and his mind became clearer and clearer.

This feeling caused joy in Lu Yuan’s heart.

According to what was happening now, the spirit qi was refining his genetic chain, and the genetic chain was nourishing his body and mind in turn.

There seemed to be no problem.

The only problem was that his speed of absorbing spirit qi seemed to be much quicker than what the Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique introduced.

In the introduction of the Basic Spirit Qi Guiding Technique, it stated that people with relatively good talents usually needed three to five days for the entire process. For people with average talent, they might require ten days to half a month.

However, Lu Yuan succeeded the moment he closed his eyes. What sort of talent could this be considered as?

Could this be due to the evolution cube?

Lu Yuan stared at the revolving blue-colored cube as he felt joy in his heart.

......

(As expected of me!)

At this moment, Lu Yuan’s consciousness swelled and a small-scale space split apart from it.

This space was originally the size of a fist, but as he continued to absorb spirit qi, it gradually grew larger.

Finally, the space became the size of roughly a cubic meter.

Although there was nothing in this tiny space, Lu Yuan could sense the connection between him and it.

He instinctively knew what this space was.

Wasn’t this what the forum post earlier had mentioned? A space would be excavated by his gene battle tattoo the first time he absorbed spirit qi?

However, according to what the post stated, it seemed that it was exceptionally difficult to excavate such a space.

Because of it, Lu Yuan didn’t even dare to imagine that it would be so easy for him to excavate it. Everything was extremely smooth.

It was just that this space was a little tiny.

When the space no longer grew, Lu Yuan opened his eyes.

After that, he saw a stream of dawn light entering his room and couldn’t help but be startled.

He immediately turned on his mobile phone and glanced at it.

6.34 a.m.

(It’s actually already morning?!)

He somehow felt that only a few minutes had passed, not expecting that it had been so long.

Amazingly, his mental state was still very clear. It felt even clearer than after having a very high-quality sleep.

(Is this the effect of spirit energy? It’s pretty amazing!)

Lu Yuan then got off his bed. After washing himself up, he left his room.

However, when Lu Yuan had just opened the building’s door, he saw a woman with a pair of beautiful bright large eyes pushing the door open as she walked in. She had exquisite makeup on and was wearing a tight-fitting dress.

After seeing Lu Yuan, the woman smiled.

“Younger Brother Lu Yuan, are you heading to class?”

Lu Yuan nodded. “Mn, Elder Sister Qinghe, have you just finished work? It must have been tough on you.”

“Hehe. Just so coincidentally, I bought a few extra buns here. Why don’t you take them and eat them on the way?”

Li Qinghe smiled brightly and lifted the buns in her hand.

Lu Yuan felt a slight warmth in his heart and laughed.

“Elder Sister Qinghe, you seem to have bought too many buns every time ah.”

Lu Yuan moved out of the welfare agency a year ago and came to reside here.

But then Li Qinghe had stayed here even longer than Lu Yuan. The life of a weak and helpless female living alone in the slums was naturally extremely difficult.

In order to live, she had to be willing to give up everything.

However, to Lu Yuan, Li Qinghe was a good elder sister that showed relatively much care and concern for him.

In the memories of this original body, after Li Qinghe learned that Lu Yuan was an orphan and his monthly allowance was very low, she would always buy extra breakfast and give it to Lu Yuan after she returned.

She would also often talk about the precautions and major matters he needed to pay attention to in this district, telling him when he should hide away and whom he couldn’t afford to antagonize.

If it wasn’t for Li Qinghe, Lu Yuan might not have survived until now.

From the deepest of the original body’s heart, Lu Yuan was extremely grateful to Li Qinghe.

She was one of the few sources of warmth in his heart after he became an orphan.

The original body had always wanted to help Li Qinghe. But sadly, he couldn’t even earn enough to keep himself alive, let alone help others.

Lu Yuan suddenly thought of something. He was already a gene fighter. Not long later, he would move away from this place, and at that time, he could help Li Qinghe to find a good job for her, bringing her away from this chaotic district.

After seeing the smile on Lu Yuan’s face, Li Qinghe started. A strange light flashed in her eyes as she surveyed Lu Yuan.

Lu Yuan was a little puzzled. “What’s the matter?’

Li Qinghe laughed.

“I only feel that Younger Brother Lu Yuan seems a little different from before. You wouldn’t smile like this yesterday.”

Lu Yuan came to a realization and understood that the degree of his transformation was a little great.

Li Qinghe was someone from the slums and had met various types of people before. She was most probably quite sensitive in this aspect.

He then laughed.

“Actually, I encountered something good.”

“What is it?”

“Yesterday, I awakened as a gene fighter. I feel that my life might be different now, so I decided to change a little.”

Upon hearing this, Li Qinghe started and revealed a surprised smile.

She went over and patted Lu Yuan on his shoulder.

“Congratulations to you, Younger Brother Lu Yuan. In the future, you will be a major character!”

“It’s not certain yet. However, I definitely don’t have to stay in the slums anymore in the future.”

“Hmm, it would be pretty good to leave here.”

Li Qinghe nodded in agreement.

Lu Yuan looked at Li Qinghe and smiled.

“Sister Qinghe, when I leave, I will find a good job for you and bring you together with me.”

Li Qinghe was startled. She then took out a packet of cigarettes from her pocket and took one out skillfully, lighting it and taking a puff.

Her right hand was supported by her left as she puffed out white smoke. She smiled, looking at Lu Yuan.

“Why? You don’t regard this elder sister with disdain?”

Lu Yuan then replied with a straight face.

“I’ve always remembered those who treat me well and those who treat me vilely. Elder Sister Qinghe is the only one here that treats me well.”

Since Lu Yuan inherited the memories of this body, although he had no other thoughts toward Li Qinghe, he also treated her as an elder sister that cared for him.

If he could help her, he would naturally lend her a hand.

Li Qinghe fell silent. After that, she laughed and rubbed Lu Yuan on his hair.

“Right now, the situation is not set yet. Let’s talk again when the time comes. Take the buns and go to school first, don’t be late for your class. Elder Sister Qing doesn’t know much about matters of gene fighters, but you should handle those step-by-step and remember to always pay attention to your safety first.”

“I’ll make a move first then.”

Lu Yuan helplessly tidied his messed-up hair. He then took two buns and went out of the building’s door.

Meanwhile, Li Qinghe glanced at the tightly-closed door and fell silent. She then snuffed out the cigarette in her hand and chewed on a bun.

She walked to Lu Yuan’s room. After standing there for a while, she narrowed her bright large eyes and stepped forward, moving through the door and entering the room. After that, the door behind her shut tightly.

As Li Qinghe chewed on the bun, she glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, her eyes landed on an old notebook as well as the three-step plan that Lu Yuan had prepared for the sake of entering the Land of Origins.

She walked over and looked, then she laughed.

“The anti-social little boy has really grown up.”

She shook her head and left through the door, returning to the building’s lounge. After that, she continued to eat her buns before returning to her own room.

...

Actually, Lu Yuan didn’t go to school.

This original body might be anti-social, but he was pretty intelligent. His results in the cultural classes had always been near the top.

(As expected of my previous life!)

Lu Yuan naturally didn’t need to worry about the cultural classes, having applied for leave from the teacher in charge. He planned to use the remaining time to focus on improving as a gene fighter.

The teacher naturally could understand this point and directly agreed to his request with no objections.

For the following two months, Lu Yuan could choose not to attend classes.

Hence, he wanted to go to the shopping district today.

That’s right, he had to prepare some necessities for his trip to the Land of Origins.

As the saying goes, with rations in hand, panic does not appear in one’s heart.

It was the same thing for money.

Holding his card that contained over \$5,000, Lu Yuan felt as though he owned this entire world. Even the way he walked was tinged with a little arrogance.

He wore his best clothes, which were also his school uniform, and strode with large steps into the shopping district as he began to shop.

The purchasing power of the red maple coins was slightly stronger compared to the RMB* in his previous life, but it wasn’t that much stronger.

\$5,000 actually wasn’t considered a lot.

Luckily, what Lu Yuan bought were all common goods.

Compressed biscuits that were used by the military, energy bars, filling bread, and bottled water.

He also purchased insect repellent that was necessary for survival out in the wild, deodorant, ropes, etc.

Originally, Lu Yuan planned to buy a sleeping bag and a tent, but after thinking that he could only spend 24 hours there, he decided to save money.

Leave the sleep to the dead. If he lived, he could always sleep after he exited the Land of Origins.

However, just all these miscellaneous items already cost roughly \$1,000.

He only had \$4,000 remaining.

Lu Yuan then took the money and went to the alloy weapon shop in the shopping district.

      'MY GENES CAN EVOLVE LIMITLESSLY',
      '''When Lu Yuan came out from the alloy weapon shop, he was in a daze.

At this moment, there was an additional 1.5 meters big, pitch-black sword that was gleaming in cold light in his battle tattoo space.

A1-type Blacklight Alloy Sword.

It was the lowest grade alloy equipment, but it cost Lu Yuan \$3,700.

And this was a price Lu Yuan had gotten after he kept on haggling.

Otherwise, it’d be \$3,900, a whole \$200 more!

Lu Yuan had initially thought of wanting to buy armor, but by the looks of it...

Back then, why did he have the confidence that he’d be able to buy both a weapon and armor with just \$4,000?

Lu Yuan then looked at the \$300 in his pocket. He had previously thought of changing the environment to live in.

But he didn’t even dare to think of that now.

(What is it that shrouded my eyes?)

(It’s poverty.)

After leaving the shopping district, Lu Yuan didn’t even dare to turn back for an additional look.

......

He had taken a taxi to the shopping district. But now, he only had \$300 left in his pockets, which he’d need for food. Hence, he had no choice but to walk back.

Fortunately, after absorbing spirit qi, Lu Yuan realized that his stamina was a lot better than before, and he had also gotten a little stronger.

Although the shopping district was over ten kilometers away from the slums, he jogged his way back, taking only slightly over half an hour to arrive.

The slums looked a lot more harmonious during the day than at night. The passersby along the streets were busy on their way, some of them looking lean and haggard.

Unfortunately, both sides of the road were covered in trash. There were children picking trash by the roadside, bringing back the useful things home.

On the sides, there were a few ruffians who had dyed their hair into varying colors. They had their hands in their pockets, occasionally looking at the passersby as they kept on shaking their bodies.

Not looking at them, Lu Yuan lowered his head slightly, entering the district he lived in and then his rental apartment.

The living room was very quiet.

The apartment he rented had a total of four rooms.

One belonged to him, one to Elder Sister Qinghe, and two others that a middle-aged woman and a couple lived in respectively.

However, the middle-aged woman and the couple usually left very early in the day, so there were very few chances of them meeting.

Elder Sister Qinghe, on the other hand, worked at night. Therefore, she should be sleeping now.

Lu Yuan closed the door gently and entered his room.

Thereafter, he switched on his laptop and logged on to the battleweb. He then started to watch the videos on the Military Fist and Military Swordplay.

The space in the room was very small. Thankfully, Lu Yuan was only in the beginning phase of his training so his movements were very slow. Therefore, he didn’t knock into things and cause any damage.

Lu Yuan continued until the sun set. He was covered in sweat and he put away the Blacklight Alloy Sword in his hand to sit down on his bed to rest.

At this moment, the sound of a door opening and then closing rang out from outside. Lu Yuan knew that it was Elder Sister Qinghe who had gone off to work.

Lu Yuan couldn’t help but let out a sigh.

If it was in his previous life, a girl like Li Qinghe would be liked by many guys and receive their adoration.

It wouldn’t be like how things were in this world, where even surviving was difficult.

After some rest, Lu Yuan sat down crossed-legged and started absorbing spirit qi.

As he absorbed it, his body started to feel warm. His fatigued body also felt quite relieved.

To Lu Yuan’s surprise, when his body was fatigued, there’d be a better effect when he cultivated the Spirit Qi Guiding Technique than when it wasn’t.

It was no wonder they said that physical training techniques were effective in raising one’s spirit qi. So this was why.

The relationship between the physical body and mental energy to spirit qi was both opposing and complementary.

…

The next morning, Lu Yuan headed out, planning to look for a quiet place outside to practice physical training techniques.

Just then, the door opened and Li Qinghe entered.

She was holding shengjians*. When she saw Lu Yuan, she smiled and said,

“Younger Brother Lu Yuan, here, I bought too many.”

Lu Yuan smiled.

“Thank you, Elder Sister Qinghe.”

He reached out his hand to take the shengjians from her.

“Oh right, Younger Brother Lu Yuan, are you practicing fist techniques?”

“How does Elder Sister Qinghe know?”

“You were so loud last night that I heard it from my room.”

Lu Yuan was stunned for a moment.

He knew that the soundproofing of the rooms wasn’t good because he often heard the couple making noises at night.

However, he didn’t expect that the sound of him practicing fist techniques would be heard as well.

He nodded. “En, I’m planning to enter the Land of Origins, so I’ll have to practice defensive physical training techniques.”

“Oh,”

Li Qinghe nodded, wearing an expression as if she didn’t really understand.

She then said, “I know of a place that’s good for practicing fist techniques.”

Lu Yuan was stunned and he looked at Li Qinghe.

“Really? Where is it?”

He was about to go look for a quiet place to practice physical training techniques, but he didn’t expect Li Qinghe to know of one.

What he wanted came to him. Was this the legendary main lead treatment?

(As expected of me.)

“This sister has been in the slums for quite some time. There’s a friend I know who opened a dojo. You can practice your fist techniques there. I’ll bring you there later.”

“Sister, you’re going to bring me there? Will I be disturbing your rest? It’s tiring for you to work at night too.”

Li Qinghe took out a cigarette from her chest, lit it, and took a puff. She then smiled heartily and said.

“It won’t take much time for me to bring you there.”

After hearing her reply, Lu Yuan nodded in agreement.

After having breakfast, Li Qinghe brought Lu Yuan out.

On the way, both Li Qinghe and Lu Yuan had their heads lowered slightly. Both of them seemed to be in a slight rush.

Look less, hear less, and not meddle in other people’s businesses.

This was what Li Qinghe had taught Lu Yuan.

It was how ordinary people in the slums lived.

The both of them took a few turns along some streets that had a stench and then finally arrived in front of an extremely battered-looking metal door.

The door with the big words ‘Daming Dojo*’ above it was flickering with neon lights that seemed to be a little spoiled.

Outside the door, a few strong men were squatting at the side and smoking.

When the two of them got near, the few men raised their heads to take a look. After seeing Li Qinghe, their eyes lit up. A man who had a scar on his left eye even whistled flirtatiously.

Lu Yuan frowned, but Li Qinghe smiled charmingly at that man.

The scarred man stood up and said, smiling.

“Miss, aren’t you quite coquettish-looking? Are you here to look for me?”

Li Qinghe smiled and said.

“I’m here to look for Brother Ming.”

Hearing these, the other few men who were raring to make a move paused. The smile of the scarred man also froze.

After that, he didn’t say a word and quietly squatted down to continue smoking.

Lu Yuan felt a little puzzled as he looked at the few strong men who became silent.

Li Qinghe said to him.

“Come with me.”

Lu Yuan followed Li Qinghe and entered the place.

It was a huge drill ground with quite a lot of equipment and facilities.

There were metal dummies, gym facilities, boxing rings, and others.

Many people were shouting as they did physical training and practiced their fist techniques. Some were even practicing blade techniques and other fighting techniques.

Lu Yuan watched as a strong man with a mechanical arm punched heavily onto a metal dummy, causing it to become deformed. He felt a little surprised that there was such a place in the slums.

He asked curiously.

“Elder Sister Qinghe, who is Brother Ming? How did you get to know him?”

Li Qinghe raised her brows at Lu Yuan, revealing a strange smile.

“Young brother, are you sure that you want to know? How detailed do you want to know?”

Upon hearing this answer, Lu Yuan’s lips twitched and he laughed dryly.

“... forget it.”

Li Qinghe smiled and then led Lu Yuan into the dojo.

In the depths of the dojo, a strong man almost two meters tall with brown hair was punching a metal dummy. He wore a black tight-fitted singlet and had exaggerated muscles all over his body.

Bang bang bang bang!

Each punch was very heavy, leaving deep marks on the dummy.

Lu Yuan’s pupils contracted upon seeing this.

This was actual metal. To think that this guy could leave such punch marks on it.

Was this guy still human?

Could he be a gene fighter?

When Lu Yuan and Li Qinghe got close, the strong man stopped his actions and then turned to look toward them.

His gaze swept at Lu Yuan and then stopped on Li Qinghe. After that, he broke into a strange smile and spoke in a rough voice.

“Why have you come?”

Li Qinghe got close while smiling, gently poking the strong man’s chest.

“Isn’t it because I miss you?”

The strong man turned to look toward Lu Yuan.

“Who is this kid?”

“He’s my younger brother. I’m thinking of letting him train at your place for a little, so he’ll be able to protect himself.”

“Your younger brother? Let him train here then. I won’t ask you for money.”

The strong man was surprisingly easy to talk to, waving his hand and agreeing to it right away.

Lu Yuan thought that this person would be very fierce.

Li Qinghe spoke up, “Younger Brother Lu Yuan, he is the boss here, Fu Langming. You can call him Brother Ming.”

Lu Yuan quickly nodded and said, smiling. “Thank you, Brother Ming.”

Fu Langming waved his hand and broke into a shameless smile. “Feel free to look around by yourself. Qinghe, come in with me.”

After saying that, he turned to enter a room at the side. Li Qinghe then gave Lu Yuan a weird smile and said, “Go look around by yourself. I’ll be going in.”

Lu Yuan: “...”

He nodded, feeling very complicated inside.

Was such a dealing something that an underaged kid like him could see?

When Li Qinghe entered the room and closed the door, Fu Langming had closed the curtains.

Unlike what Lu Yuan thought, Fu Langming was standing very straight. He looked at Li Qinghe.

“Madam!”

Li Qinghe lit a cigarette and sat on the brown real leather sofa, crossing her legs.

“En.”

Fu Langming snuck a look at Li Qinghe and asked carefully,

“Madam… that kid outside, who on earth is he?”

Li Qinghe smiled and said, “A younger brother I met by chance. He’s quite a kind-hearted child. He has just awakened his genes and hasn’t entered the Land of Origins. I plan on letting him train over at your place. Just teach him as you see fit.”

Fu Langming understood. He patted his brick-like chest.

“No problem! Leave it to me!”

“But don’t overdo it and expose yourself.”

“Your subordinate understands.”

“En, I’ll go out after staying for a little longer.”

Li Qinghe then took out her phone and started to play a game.

Fu Langming looked hesitant but still said.

“…Madam, can you stay a little longer?”

Li Qinghe looked up at Fu Langming. “Reason?”

“Cough... If the time is too short, it won’t sound too good...”

“Hmm?”

Li Qinghe squinted her eyes and revealed a brilliant smile.

All of a sudden, Fu Langming’s countenance turned pale and he quickly added.

“No no no, I was wrong! You make the call!”

Li Qinghe withdrew her smile. She then thought of something and said.

“Oh, right. There’s a man outside with a scar on his left eye. I don’t wish to see him again.”

“I understand!”

      '''Five minutes later, Li Qinghe finished her matching game and stood up, walking toward the door.

“You don’t have to come out.”

Fu Langming, who was standing straight, heaved a sigh of relief.

“Yes!”

When Lu Yuan, who was practicing his Military Fist in a corner, saw Li Qinghe coming out, he quickly walked over.

“Elder Sister Qinghe, are you alright?”

Li Qinghe broke into an ambiguous smile.

“What can happen to me? Brother Ming and I have known each other for very long.”

Lu Yuan: “...”

He fell silent for a moment before saying,

“I have to thank Elder Sister Qinghe this time.”

“I’m still waiting for Younger Brother Lu Yuan to make it big and bring me out from this damn place in the future.”

Li Qinghe patted Lu Yuan’s shoulder, smiling.

......

Hearing this, Lu Yuan looked at Li Qinghe and nodded seriously. “Don’t worry, I will.”

“Alright, we’ll talk about other things in the future. Brother Ming has agreed for you to be practicing here. After he comes out, you can go and ask him to teach you.”

Lu Yuan nodded.

“I’ll be going back first then. I’m so sleepy.”

Li Qinghe covered her mouth with her hand and let out a yawn. She then bade goodbye to Lu Yuan and left Daming Dojo.

Lu Yuan continued practicing his Military Fist.

A few minutes later, Fu Langming came out as well, wearing a satisfied smile on his face. Lu Yuan took a look and then lowered his head slightly.

Fu Langming saw Lu Yuan and walked over, revealing his white teeth as he grinned.

“Lu Yuan is it? I heard from Qinghe that you want to practice physical training techniques here? Are you learning Military Fist and Military Swordplay?”

Lu Yuan nodded. “That’s right.”

Fu Langming assessed Lu Yuan and then said, “Let me take a look at them.”

Lu Yuan took a deep breath and started executing the Military Fist.

Lu Yuan had only been practicing the Military Fist for less than a day. Although he had learned the moves, his flow wasn’t smooth. However, Lu Yuan’s strength wasn’t weak, so even though he wasn’t skillful at it, his punches still seemed strong.

In the beginning, Fu Langming, who was at the side, didn’t seem too interested. But then his expression gradually became solemn. As he looked at the fist wind, a stunned expression appeared on his face.

The power of this fist force didn’t seem like it came from a new gene fighter who hadn’t entered the Land of Origins before.

After performing a set of fist techniques, Lu Yuan’s face was a little flushed and he was panting slightly.

He then turned and looked at Fu Langming, realizing that Fu Langming looked stunned.

Lu Yuan paused. “What is it?”

Fu Langming came back to his senses, his expression looking a little strange as he asked, “...Qinghe said that you were awakened the day before?”

Lu Yuan nodded. “That’s right, Brother Ming. Is there any problem?”

Fu Langming was silent for a moment and said.

“Come, give me a punch.”

Lu Yuan was stunned and looked at Fu Langming. “Brother Ming, are you asking me to punch you?”

“Why? You’re afraid that you’d hurt me? Hurry up and do it.”

Fu Langming revealed an expression that had a hint of impatience on it.

Lu Yuan’s lips twitched.

This Fu Langming was very strong and Lu Yuan wasn’t his opponent. What could he do?

He should just throw a punch then.

After drawing his fist back in a lunge position, he twisted his waist and smashed his punch out. As a result, fist wind seethed and his fist flew toward Fu Langming’s chest.

Sensing that fist wind, Fu Langming’s pupils contracted a little. He raised his big palm and stopped Lu Yuan’s fist.

Lu Yuan realized that his fist seemed to have hit a strong metal wall and was unable to advance any further. However, Fu Langming’s body didn’t even move in the slightest.

This made him even more certain that the difference between his and Fu Langming’s strength wasn’t just a little.

He was still very weak.

Just as Lu Yuan’s mind was wandering off, Fu Langming’s voice rang out.

“...Did you really just awaken?”

Lu Yuan looked at Fu Langming, feeling a little puzzled. This was the second time he was asked this question.

Was there something wrong with him?

Lu Yuan was a little puzzled.

“Yes, I just awakened.”

Fu Langming looked at Lu Yuan with a strange gaze.

“How long did it take you to sense spirit qi when you first tried to move it? And how long did it take you to absorb it later?”

Lu Yuan was surprised. Only then did he realize what his problem was.

He seemed to be too amazing!

His power was a little strong and didn’t seem like a gene fighter who had just awakened.

However, there was no way he could say that he was able to sense spirit qi without meditation. This was too absurd.

Lu Yuan thought about it for a moment before saying.

“It took me less than half a day to absorb spirit qi.”

An instant was also considered to be less than half a day, right?

Lu Yuan changed his way of saying things.

Upon hearing Lu Yuan’s words, Fu Langming’s eyes were wide open.

He then let out a dry cough, breaking into a slight smile.

“Cough... Lu Yuan is it? Since Qinghe has left you to me, I’ll reluctantly accept you as my disciple since your aptitude isn’t bad. How about it?”

Lu Yuan was a little stunned and then he asked.

“Brother Ming, are you very strong?”

“I...”

Fu Langming was about to say something when he suddenly remembered Qinghe’s reminder earlier. Hence, he forced himself to shut up.

He then said, “Cough, although I have just broken through to become a tier-1 fighter, I’ll become very strong in the future!”

Lu Yuan: “?”

(Just that?)

(Only a fighter?)

(Isn’t he not that much stronger than me then?)

(At least I have limitless potential.)

Lu Yuan was instantly speechless, so he let out a dry laugh and then said, “Brother Ming is really amazing, but I haven’t gone to university yet. We’ll see after I’ve started to attend university.”

Hearing Lu Yuan’s words, Fu Langming frowned slightly. He could clearly hear the halfheartedness in Lu Yuan’s voice.

However, since Lu Yuan had been brought here by Qinghe, Fu Langming didn’t dare to do anything to Lu Yuan. He only wore a forced smile and nodded.

“Alright then. We’ll talk about this after you’ve gone to university.”

Lu Yuan looked at Fu Langming with some surprise.

He thought that Fu Langming would fly into a rage, but he didn’t expect him not to be angry at all.

Seemed like he was a good guy.

However, Lu Yuan probably would have to keep a low profile in the future.

At the very least, when things weren’t safe enough, he mustn’t appear too amazing.

Fu Langming continued talking.

“If you want to become good at physical training techniques, training alone won’t work. I’ll arrange a few opponents for you. You’ll spar with them!”

After saying that, Fu Langming turned and called a strong man who was practicing fist techniques not far away.

“Little Tiger!”

The strong man turned his head, wearing a simple-minded smile on his rectangular face. He then came running over.

“Brother Ming!”

“En, go up to the ring and have a round with this kid.”

“Huh? This beansprout?”

Little Tiger looked at Lu Yuan and couldn’t help but break into a bitter expression.

“I’m afraid that he will end up dying because I fail to hold back... Why not get someone else?”

Hearing that, Lu Yuan raised his brows slightly, not saying anything.

“Stop with the crap! You do it! Otherwise, I’ll spar against you!”

Hearing this, Little Tiger quickly became solemn. “Alright! I’ll do it right now!”

Only then did Fu Langming nod in satisfaction.

“The two of you, come with me.”

He led the two of them to an arena.

At this moment, two strong men were sparring in the arena, landing heavy punches on each other. Their bodies and faces were covered in bruises.

Many people under the arena were watching the battle, cheering and booing non-stop.

“Old Cat! Can you do it? Straight punch! Right hook! F*ck him up!”

“Mountain Boar! Use more force! Did you not f*cking eat?! Beat him! Beat that s*ssy up!”

However, the people watching the fight immediately made way when they saw Fu Langming coming over. Some of them looked at Fu Langming and the other two curiously, especially at Lu Yuan, who was an unfamiliar face to them.

Fu Langming slapped the arena’s floor, making loud sounds.

“Stop!”

Fu Langming’s words were very effective here. The two men who had been fighting intensely a moment ago punched each other once and then retreated.

The two of them rubbed the wounds on their faces, panting heavily while glaring at each other. After that, they looked in Fu Langming’s direction.

“Brother Ming.”

Fu Langming beckoned at them and then said.

“Come down! We’re changing fighters!”

“Changing fighters?”

Not only were Old Cat and Mountain Boar stunned, but so were the people watching the fight.

Someone then asked in anticipation,

“Is Brother Ming planning on having a round in the ring?”

“Little Tiger is the sandbag? That’s great!”

“Hurry up and start! Hurry up and start! Brother Ming is amazing!”

When Little Tiger heard everyone’s words, he continued to wear a simple-minded smile. He then scratched his head and said.

“Brothers, you’ll be disappointed. Brother Ming isn’t going to fight. The ones fighting in the ring will be me and this beansprout here.”

Little Tiger pointed at Lu Yuan.

At this moment, everyone sized up Lu Yuan and was instantly disappointed.

“Him? He isn’t even as thick as my arm. Won’t you have to pray that he doesn’t die after punching him?”

“A new face? Why is a s*ssy like him not receiving guests at Goldenglow Entertainment Club but coming here?”

“Hey! S*ssy! You won’t get so scared later that you piss yourself in the pants, would you?”

“Hahahahaha!”

Everyone whistled and laughed at Lu Yuan.

Brother Ming crossed his thick arms and was also laughing loudly.

He looked at Lu Yuan mockingly.

“How is it? Kid, are you up for it?”

Lu Yuan raised his brows and took a look at them. After that, he quietly rolled up his sleeves.

“I’ll give it a try.”

Little Tiger scratched his head while wearing a simple-minded smile. “I won’t be paying for the medical bills if I end up beating you up till you can’t get up!”

Lu Yuan tugged his lips. “I don’t need you to pay for it.”

“Since both of you have come to an agreement, the two of you can go up now.”

Under everyone’s whistles, Lu Yuan and Little Tiger got up onto the arena.''',

      '''In the arena, Lu Yuan and Little Tiger faced each other.

Fu Langming, who was below, patted the floor.

“Start!”

The two of them looked at each other. Little Tiger scratched his head and smiled simple-mindedly, saying.

“You can attack first.”

The audience was also shouting,

“S*ssy! Hurry! Hurry and attack! This is your only chance!”

“That’s right! Give Little Tiger a punch! This is a man’s pride! Prove that you’re at least not a s*ssy!”

“...”

Lu Yuan, who was in the ring, grinned. He then used a technique from the Military Fist and took a step forward.

His body, nurtured by the genetic chain, erupted in power, rapidly charging up to Little Tiger.

He twisted his waist and swung his arm, punching out straight for Little Tiger’s chest.

Fist wind blew!

......

Upon feeling the strength of the fist wind, Little Tiger’s smile froze.

He quickly pressed both hands down to put up a block in front of Lu Yuan’s fist.

Bang!

Little Tiger’s blocking hands hit his own chest due to the punch’s impact, and his countenance changed. His body kept backing off and he almost fell off the ring.

The intense pain caused his countenance to change drastically, turning a little pale.

After that, he raised his head and looked at Lu Yuan with a hint of astonishment, not saying a word even after very long.

The mocking laughter from the audience came to a stop too. Everyone looked at Lu Yuan, who was twisting his wrist, then at Little Tiger, who was holding onto his chest. All of them exchanged glances.

“This... this beansprout has such great strength?”

“That can’t be real, right? This s*ssy has such speed? That fist wind... it is something.”

“...”

At this moment, Fu Langming grinned and said.

“Little Tiger, I forgot to tell you. This kid is a gene fighter. If you don’t wish to be beaten up until you’re bedridden, you better go all out.”

Little Tiger: “????”

He looked at the beaming Fu Langming, feeling stunned and looking like he was on the verge of tears.

“Gene fighter?! Brother Ming, why didn’t you tell me that earlier?!”

The other people also revealed astonished expressions, and their gazes when looking at Lu Yuan changed.

“To think that he is a gene fighter... no wonder.”

“If he’s a gene fighter, then it’s understandable that he has such power.”

Gene fighters were few in numbers to begin with, and they were even rarer in such slums.

Seeing a gene fighter here was as amazing as being able to see a panda.

All the audience sized up Lu Yuan with curious expressions.

Lu Yuan looked at Little Tiger who was rubbing his chest, and his expression slowly changed. He then smiled and said.

“Don’t worry. If I beat you up till you can’t get up, I won’t pay the medical fees either.”

Little Tiger grinned. “Beansprout, I underestimated you. But I don’t think that you’re a very strong gene fighter either, right? This power isn’t stronger than me.”

As he said this, he dashed out toward Lu Yuan.

“Then let me show you the difference in techniques!”

Fist, leg, elbow, knee—every part of Little Tiger seemed to have turned into a weapon, attacking Lu Yuan like a tempest.

Until one day ago, Lu Yuan hadn’t gotten into fights that much.

Hence, although he had practiced the Military Fist for a day, he had almost zero combat experience. Upon facing the tempest-like attacks, his pupils contracted abruptly and he could only keep on defending.

Suddenly, he was in a sorry state and had to keep backing off.

Thankfully, after he started cultivating, his power had increased a lot, seeming to be about the level of Little Tiger who often practiced fist techniques. Moreover, his mental power was probably stronger than Little Tiger because he could sharply detect the path of Little Tiger’s attacks.

Although he was in a sorry state and he’d still get punched occasionally, he was still able to forcibly hold off the attacks.

Bang bang bang!!!

The stifled sounds of fists and legs colliding rang out. The intense fight between the two of them caused the spectators to be immersed in it as well.

After being in a stalemate for a while, Lu Yuan suddenly moved to the side and dodged Little Tiger’s elbow attack. After that, he raised his kneecap and kicked the side of Little Tiger’s stomach.

As a result, Little Tiger’s countenance turned pale and he backed off a few steps.

All the spectators opened their eyes wide.

“To think that he is already able to retaliate?”

“That’s right. This kid’s power and speed are both about the same as Little Tiger, but the difference in their technique and experience is very big. Earlier on, he had been suppressed by Little Tiger, but it didn’t take him long before he started to retaliate.”

“Is this what a gene fighter is like? To think that they are so p*rverse!”

The spectators who had called Lu Yuan a s*ssy or beansprout earlier on started to change the way they called him as the fight progressed.

The capabilities that Lu Yuan had shown were enough to make many people look at him with admiration.

Fu Langming had been paying attention to Lu Yuan. Hence, when Lu Yuan made his first retaliation, he opened his eyes wide and grinned, mumbling in his heart.

(What horrifying learning and adaptive abilities! He must be born with such combat instincts, right?! In addition to that horrifying aptitude, what kind of monster has Madam Qinghe found?! This kid can probably be compared with the descendants from the big clans in the empire! To think that such a monster can come from the slums?! This must be a joke, right?)

He looked at Lu Yuan’s dodging figure and his gaze flickered.

(This won’t do. I must pull him to my side! I’ll go talk to Madam about this later on!)

As the fight continued, Lu Yuan’s retaliations became increasingly intense.

From being suppressed and beaten up by Little Tiger who had rich experience and techniques, gradually Lu Yuan became increasingly masterful of the Military Fist. He started to dodge and retaliate.

Now, every time Little Tiger hit Lu Yuan four times, Lu Yuan would be able to retaliate once.

This was inevitably a tremendous progress.

However, as the fight had gone on for a very long time, Lu Yuan and Little Tiger’s stamina were bottoming out.

The two of them kept on panting, and their movements weren’t in proper forms anymore. The power of their attacks had become weak as well.

At the sight of this, Fu Langming spoke up.

“Alright! Stop!”

Hearing this, Little Tiger stopped immediately.

However, Lu Yuan still swung out his fist, hitting Little Tiger in the face.

Little Tiger covered his face, which was becoming red and swollen at a rate that could be seen by the n*ked eye. He then opened his eyes wide and looked at Lu Yuan.

“Weren’t we told to stop?!”

Lu Yuan rubbed the swollen patch on the corner of his lips, grinning in pain, but his gaze looked very innocent.

“I wasn’t able to draw back my punch.”

Hearing this answer, Little Tiger glared with his big eyes and opened his mouth, wanting to say something but not knowing what to say.

At this moment, Fu Langming crossed his arms in front of his chest and said, “Take a rest. We’ll continue again later!”

Little Tiger’s lips twitched and he asked, “Brother Ming, do I still have to spar with him?”

“Why?”

Right now, Little Tiger was looking at Lu Yuan and scratching his head speechlessly.

“If we continue, I’m afraid that I’ll be the one to get beaten up.”

There was no helping it. Lu Yuan’s performance was too atrocious. It had only been a little while, but he was already able to retaliate.

If he was given another afternoon, Little Tiger didn’t have the confidence that he’d be able to win against Lu Yuan.

In Little Tiger’s heart, Lu Yuan was like a monster.

Lu Yuan smiled. “It’s fine. I won’t pay for your medical fees.”

“How is that fine?!”

Little Tiger shouted, feeling dissatisfied.

Fu Langming patted Little Tiger’s shoulder and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll reimburse you for the medical fees.”

Little Tiger looked a little stunned at Fu Langming. He then tugged his lips and said in a crying tone.

“Thank you!”

Thereafter, Lu Yuan and Little Tiger got some rest.

During the break time, Lu Yuan circulated some spirit qi to clear his body’s fatigue. At the same time, he thought back on the parts that he didn’t do well during the earlier fight. He kept on learning from his lessons, wanting to improve.

Fu Langming was right.

Combat experience could really allow one to improve a lot in physical training technique. Lu Yuan’s progress was a lot faster than when he was practicing by himself.

He felt that it wouldn’t take long before he could grasp the Military Fist completely. The Military Swordplay would be next then.

Thereafter, he’d be able to enter the Land of Origins and search for a gene suitable for him. He’d be able to then engrave and record the gene as well as evolve it, moving onto the correct course.

In the afternoon, Lu Yuan and Little Tiger started sparring again.

This time around, there were even more spectators than before.

Everyone looked at the two people in the arena and whispered amongst themselves.

“Is this for real? To think that this beansprout can put up a fight against Little Tiger?”

“What beansprout?! Call him Brother Yuan! Brother Yuan is a gene fighter! His prospects will definitely be bright and limitless!”

“Putting aside how the future will be, it’s true that Brother Yuan is very amazing. In the morning, Little Tiger was still able to suppress Brother Yuan and beat him up with his rich experience. But how long has it only been? Brother Yuan has started to retaliate. Who amongst you will be able to compare with his learning abilities?”

“As expected of a gene fighter. Brother Yuan is really amazing. If Brother Yuan wants to become a gangster in the future, I wonder if I can join him and have him as my Boss?”

“You haven’t woken up, have you? As a gene fighter, won’t Brother Yuan have to battle against demonic beasts in the future? Won’t he have to battle it out against other races? Why would he play with people like us?”

Everyone found these words to be reasonable and all of them nodded.

The battle started once again.

However, it didn’t begin like the first round where Little Tiger could still suppress Lu Yuan. During the fight, Little Tiger could sense clearly that Lu Yuan’s flaws were getting increasingly fewer, and the pressure he was feeling was getting increasingly greater.

It wasn’t that long into the fight when Little Tiger’s forehead was covered in sweat.

In the morning, Lu Yuan was only able to retaliate about once after every four attacks.

Gradually, he was able to retaliate once after every three attacks.

Then two times.

In the end, the spectators noticed that Lu Yuan was already able to fight on par with Little Tiger. He no longer was on defense with some retaliation.

As time moved on, what everyone found unbelievable was that Lu Yuan started to suppress Little Tiger and beat him up.

Bang!

It wasn’t long before Lu Yuan consecutively jabbed out, as well as attacking with his elbows and knees. He caused Little Tiger to back off consecutively. In the end, Lu Yuan managed to grab hold of the chance and punched Little Tiger in the stomach.

Little Tiger’s face turned pale, and he fell to the ground while holding onto his stomach, letting out a deep moan.

The entire place sank into silence.

Everyone turned quiet and exchanged glances.

“He.... he won?!”

“Brother Yuan is amazing! To think that he managed to defeat Little Tiger in less than a day?!”

“As expected of my Brother Yuan! He’s too strong!”

Everyone cheered.

Little Tiger, who was lying on the floor and hearing everyone’s cheers, had his head filled with question marks.

He took a look at the spectators, his gaze filled with puzzlement.

He was a little stunned at his companions’ betrayal.

They had spent so much time together in the same dojo. Why?

Why did all these f*cking b*stards betray him?!

Fu Langming crossed his arms in front of his chest and smiled as he looked at Lu Yuan.

“Kid, you didn’t do too badly.”

Little Tiger who was lying on the floor: “??”

He suddenly felt like crying. He was a child nobody wanted.

Lu Yuan smiled. “Brother Ming, thank you for your praise. I still have a long way to go. I can only be considered to have passed when I can defeat you.”

Fu Langming nodded, expressing that what Lu Yuan said was right.

Lu Yuan: “...”

He was only acting humble but didn’t expect that Fu Langming had taken it for real.

He actually thought that he was pretty amazing. After all, he was able to practice the Military Fist to this stage within a day.

Next would be the Military Swordplay.

Fu Langming seemed to have seen through Lu Yuan’s thoughts and said.

“It’s already late. We’ll stop here for today. Come here tomorrow, I’ll teach you the sword.”

Lu Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said, smiling. “Alright, thank you Brother Ming.”''',

      '''After Lu Yuan left, Fu Langming secretly returned to his office. He then took out his phone and dialed a number.

Next to Lu Yuan’s room, in a simple room with only a bed and a desk, Li Qinghe was seated cross-legged on the bed to cultivate.

Suddenly, Li Qinghe frowned slightly. She flipped over her right hand and a small pitch-black cube landed on her hand.

She tapped on the cube and a screen popped out, displaying Fu Langming’s name.

Li Qinghe picked up the phone and a cold voice rang out.

“You have five seconds to explain.”

Fu Langming, who was on the other end of the call, was breaking out in cold sweat.

(This is bad! I forgot that Madam hates people disturbing him when she’s cultivating!)

He quickly said, “Madam, it’s about Lu Yuan!”

“Lu Yuan?”

Li Qinghe raised her brows. “What happened to him? What did I tell you?”

“No no no, Madam, it’s not that something had happened to Lu Yuan. His... his aptitude is very strong! Extremely strong!”

“Hmm? What do you mean?”

......

Fu Langming organized his thoughts before saying.

“Didn’t you say that he was awakened two days ago? But he has started to refine his genetic chain with spirit energy. Didn’t I say that I was going to teach him physical training techniques today? Turns out that his strength is about the same level as an expert under me. I’m guessing that he has probably gone through a certain degree of refinement. I asked him about this, and he said that he was able to absorb spirit qi in just half a day.”

Li Qinghe paused and a hint of a stunned gaze flashed past her eyes.

“He managed to absorb spirit qi in just half a day? ! Are you sure?”

“I feel that he shouldn’t have exaggerated things. After all, his strength is a lot stronger than normal people.”

Li Qinghe furrowed her brows slightly, fell silent, and then spoke up.

“I got it. So what do you want to say by calling me?”

“Cough... Madam is really perceptive... I want to take him into my team.”

“Scram!”

Li Qinghe replied coldly and hung up the call.

Fu Langming, who was on the other end of the call, listened to the sound of the line being cut off. His face still looked stunned and he didn’t react to the situation.

In the room, Li Qinghe put away her communication device and lay down. Her wonderful figure was completely exposed. She squinted her eyes and looked at the ceiling, breaking into a hint of a smile.

(I didn’t expect that little kid to turn out to have such aptitude? Half a day? That’s almost catching up to me. This is a little interesting. Am I so lucky? A pitiful little kid that I encountered has such aptitude too?)

Her gaze flickered, and she seemed to be thinking of something.

…

Lu Yuan then returned to the rental apartment and his room. It was very quiet.

He took a look at Li Qinghe’s closed room door.

(It’s already this late. Elder Sister Qinghe should have gone off to work.)

Lu Yuan thought of thanking Li Qinghe. After some thought, he planned on treating her to a good meal after he managed to get some money.

Lu Yuan then shook his head and returned to his room.

After taking a shower, the fatigue Lu Yuan was feeling gushed up. His body, which was gradually getting firmer, was covered in bruises left by Little Tiger.

He touched a bruise on his stomach and was in so much pain that he clenched his teeth.

“F*ck! He was really vicious!”

He bore with the fatigue and sat down cross-legged before circulating the Spirit Qi Guiding Technique.

Just then, a strange voice rang out from another side.

Lu Yuan’s countenance changed and he almost spurted out.

(What time is it only now?)

That couple was already starting their exercise!

How bad was their craving?!

Lu Yuan was speechless. He closed his eyes, wanting to continue with his cultivation.

However, the voices became increasingly louder.

He opened his eyes, feeling displeased. He then shouted.

“It’s time to pay rent!”

Instantly, the entire world became silent.

Lu Yuan closed his eyes in satisfaction and then continued cultivating.

…

Three days later, in Daming Dojo.

A group of strong men without any tops circled around Lu Yuan and a bald man. The two of them were wearing protective clothing and sparring with wooden swords.

The wooden swords collided, creating stifled banging sounds.

Both of them moved and not long later, Lu Yuan’s wrist shook and his longsword slashed in an arc, landing on the spot where the strong man’s sword handle was at. He then got up close and kneed the strong man, causing the latter to fall to the ground.

“Wow~ Brother Yuan won again!”

“Ironhead worked as a mercenary in the past and is skillful in sword techniques. I didn’t expect him to be defeated by Brother Yuan in merely two days!”

“As expected of my Brother Yuan! Amazing!”

Lu Yuan looked at Ironhead who was on the ground, and he let out an exhale. His hands that were holding onto the sword were still trembling slightly because he had used too much force.

After defeating Little Tiger, Lu Yuan started to look for someone to have a sword sparring with. In the end, he started sparring with Ironhead, who had worked as a mercenary and had even hunted demonic beasts before.

After spending two days, he finally grasped the Military Swordplay and defeated Ironhead.

Ironhead wasn’t a gene fighter but was an ordinary person!

This showed how strong this person’s battle techniques were.

“Are you alright?”

Lu Yuan looked at Ironhead.

Ironhead held onto his stomach and stood up. He then shook his head and grinned.

“I’ve seen quite a number of gene fighters, but none of them progressed as fast as you did. I feel that you’ll definitely become an important figure in the future.”

Lu Yuan grinned. “I feel the same.”

(What a joke. I have a cheat item and limitless potential in the future.)

Lu Yuan had this little bit of confidence.

At this moment, Fu Langming, who was at the side, walked over.

“Not bad. You’ve made huge improvements. Given your current level, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to enter the Land of Origins for the first time.”

Upon hearing that, Lu Yuan’s eyes lit up and he broke into a smile.

“Brother Ming, thank you for your help these few days. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have improved so much within such a short period.”

He also felt that given his current strength, he could try to enter the Land of Origins.

The first entry was very crucial. Being one step slower would mean that one would always be one step behind.

It was still better to reap some gains on the first trip.

Fu Langming nodded then said.

“Come with me.”

Lu Yuan followed Fu Langming to the office.

Fu Langming then pointed to the sofa. “Sit.”

As Lu Yuan sat down, Fu Langming looked at Lu Yuan and said,

“Entering the Land of Origins means that you’ll be obtaining your first extraordinary gene. This will determine the path that you’ll take. Do you know the types of gene fighters?”

Lu Yuan nodded. “I read it on the battleweb. There’s the guard-type that focuses on defense and protection, the attack-type that focuses on power and attacks, the assassination-type that focuses on infiltration and assassination...

Fu Langming nodded and then said slowly.

“Since you’ve read about it before, you should know that once you’ve engraved and recorded the first extraordinary gene, your body’s advantages will be inclined toward that gene. Although gene fighters can engrave and record genes of different types to raise their abilities in varying areas, studies show that if one focuses on one direction, the effect of engraving and recording the genes can be stacked. The benefits brought will then be the greatest. Have you decided which path to take?”

What Fu Langming said was the basic knowledge for gene fighters.

However, this was only the absolute truth for ordinary gene fighters.

Lu Yuan knew that this theory wasn’t suitable for him.

It was because he possessed the evolution cube.

Each extraordinary gene would specially strengthen one area. For example, one’s power would become stronger, one’s defensive bones would become firm and have great endurance to attacks, and the body’s agility and explosiveness would increase tremendously.

Although the other areas would be strengthened as well, the effect wouldn’t be as great as the strengthening for the areas in the original path.

Thereafter, all gene fighters would basically choose to focus on engraving and recording genes on one particular route when they were doing so. This would bring them the greatest level of benefits.

However, things were different for Lu Yuan. He could evolve all genes into their strongest form.

With that, even if this extraordinary gene didn’t bring about a big improvement in a certain area, it’d still be extremely terrifying after the effects from multiple genes were stacked and accumulated.

After all, this was the most powerful gene.

As a result, he could develop in all directions.

The sturdiest defensive ability, the strongest power, the fastest speed, the strongest will... It was the same even for the control over elements.

He’d have no flaws and would be incomparable!

However, that was something left for the future. At the very least, in his current phase, he had to choose one direction.

It’d be the direction he revealed to others.

Previously, Lu Yuan had thought about this. He planned on being an attack-type fighter.

To Lu Yuan, it didn’t matter which direction he chose.

With the evolution cube, he could be whatever he wanted to be.

It was just that to the public, those who were attack-type would be able to handle more situations in the future.

Hearing Lu Yuan’s words, Fu Langming paused for a moment and broke into a smile.

“Attack-type? attack-type is good! I’m an attack-type too!”

Lu Yuan was speechless after taking a look at him.

This guy had just attained a breakthrough to become a tier-1 fighter and had only engraved and recorded one gene. What kind of attack-type was he...''',

      'MY GENES CAN EVOLVE LIMITLESSLY',
      '''Thereafter, Lu Yuan continued to chat with Fu Langming about gene fighters. Time passed by very quickly, and it was soon night time.

Lu Yuan then bade goodbye to Fu Langming and returned to his small room.

Sitting on the bed, he turned to look out of the window.

Under the quiet night sky, neon lights were flashing in the distance, bringing out Xili City’s prosperity.

After taking in a deep breath, he emptied his nervous emotions and then closed his eyes.

It was time to start.

His consciousness integrated into his gene battle tattoo.

As a result, the golden prints on the gene battle tattoo flickered with a faint glow.

In Lu Yuan’s consciousness, the white fog was seething and it formed a door of light at the edge of the genetic chain.

Although Lu Yuan hadn’t entered it before, his instincts told him that this was the door leading to the Land of Origins.

Lu Yuan pursed his lips and his consciousness got close to the door of light.

At the next moment, his consciousness turned dark, and when he opened his eyes again, what he saw was a red scorching sun. His body instantly felt the hot temperature and dry air.

After looking around, he saw that he was in a huge square and there were many yellow buildings surrounding it.

......

The sky was the color of a dull yellow, covered in sand.

A hint of astonishment flashed in Lu Yuan’s eyes.

This Land of Origins was really miraculous. To think that it could let him come to an unfamiliar place.

It was said that all intelligent races in the entire universe could enter the Land of Origins.

This meant that the Land of Origins connected the entire universe!

No one knew where in the universe the Land of Origins was and why it could connect all intelligent races together.

All of a sudden, noisy sounds brought Lu Yuan back to his senses.

“Looking for a guard-type fighter to go to the yellow sand bugs’ nest! Only want elves!”

“Team led by an elemental-type fighter with elite-grade gene to kill sand scorpions at the stone walls! All races are accepted, except kobolds!”

“Human race newbie wants to join a human race party. Is there any big shot who is willing to help carry a newbie?”

When Lu Yuan listened to the sounds that seemed like they belonged in a marketplace, his expression was a little strange.

There were many lifeforms gathered in the square, shouting out to form parties.

Lu Yuan noticed that other than the human race, there were other races here as well.

The elves that often appeared in Earth’s fantasy stories had tall and slender figures, pointy ears, and beautiful faces.

There were also kobolds who had dog heads.

When Lu Yuan saw a beautiful-looking cat girl with a pair of cat ears and a tail that was wagging endlessly, his eyes opened wide.

(A cat has really come to repay a favor?!)

(Which l*cher would be able to hold his ground against these cat ears and tail?!)

Lu Yuan felt elated inside.

This world was really wonderful!

In this square, there were only four races: humans, elves, kobolds, and catfolks.

This was an initial city for these four races.

As for where this city was, Lu Yuan had some sort of an idea.

The scorching high temperature, the sand on the square, the murky air... This clearly looked like the stone walls area in the desert.

Amongst the four initial cities for the Great Revelation Planet’s humans, only the Sandstone City was in the desert’s stone walls area.

At the thought of the Sandstone City, Lu Yuan recalled the information he had read previously.

The Sandstone City was situated in the desert region, surrounded by sand and stone walls. Most of the monsters in this area were rock-type, poison-type, and wind-type.

As Lu Yuan was recalling the surrounding environment and monsters, someone suddenly patted him on the shoulder.

Lu Yuan frowned slightly and turned to look over.

A handsome-looking elf wearing yellow leather armor stood there, beaming.

“Human friend, are you alone?”

Lu Yuan raised his brows and said, “Is anything the matter?”

“Hahaha, we’re planning to hunt some graystone beetles. Do you want to join us? We’ll distribute the gains based on contribution.”

As the male elf said this, he pointed to three others behind him who weren’t far away. There was a tall and skinny elf, a kobold, and a human.

Lu Yuan took a look and then shook his head. “No need, thanks.”

Lu Yuan turned and planned to leave, but the male elf stopped him.

“Hey friend, don’t leave. It’s very dangerous to adventure outside by yourself. Why don’t we go together?”

Lu Yuan looked at him and answered confidently.

“Who said that I’m alone? My friend is already waiting for me outside.”

After hearing this, the male elf’s smile stiffened up.

“Oh, so you already have a partner? Alright then. I won’t be disturbing you anymore.”

He made way and Lu Yuan walked by him.

After that, the male elf’s lips twitched and he said, “So unlucky.”

The trio who weren’t far off walked over.

The kobold smiled and asked, “Leader, how is it?”

“That guy has a friend outside.”

Hearing this, all three of them wore disappointed expressions.

“That’s such a pity. Based on his reaction, he should be a complete newbie. I didn’t expect him to have someone to guide him.”

“Let’s change our target.”

The male elf let out a sigh. “It’s getting increasingly harder to deceive the newbies these days. Should we make some changes?”

“It’s too hard to do that. Why not find a time to call for a meeting and improve our deceit skills?”

“That works too. If this really doesn’t work, we’ll just go out and kill graystone beetles.”

“En.”

…

After Lu Yuan left the square, he assessed the surroundings.

Sandstone City’s streets were covered with sand, and there were buildings built from yellow rocks on both sides of the streets. Many rock giants were walking along the streets.

Lu Yuan had read about this in a post previously.

Every initial city came with constructs from the Land of Origins that could maintain the city’s minimal level of operation.

These rock giants were the constructs that came with the Sandstone City, and they maintained public security. Fighting in the city wasn’t allowed.

Sandstone City was very big. Due to time restraints, Lu Yuan jogged out and it took him two hours before he saw the city walls.

The walls were also built from yellow rocks and were about 30 meters tall.

There were huge canons on the city walls, as well as many constructs patrolling.

At this moment, Lu Yuan arrived at the city gate that was guarded by two constructs. However, there wasn’t anyone performing checks, so all the gene fighters could leave or enter the Sandstone City directly.

Lu Yuan then walked out of the city gate and what came into sight was a stretch of barren stone walls. Strong gales were blowing and sand was blown everywhere.

Lu Yuan covered his nose, feeling a little uncomfortable.

Each of the four initial cities for humans had its own horrible conditions. For example, the Storm City was surrounded by storms and if one wasn’t careful, they might get blown into the sky.

As for the Sandstone City, the degree of air pollution was too serious. One would take in a lot of sand with each inhale.

It was a little hard to get used to.

After discerning the directions, Lu Yuan then moved toward the right of the Sandstone City.

The place he was heading to was an area called the Graystone Forest.

The primary ferocious beasts in that area were graystone beetles, which were very weak ferocious beasts even amongst those at the probational tier.

The drop rate for genetic armaments and extraordinary genes from them was close to zero, but their stone armor was a material to forge genetic armaments and could be sold for money.

To Lu Yuan, it was a safe and steady option.

However, as he hadn’t contracted a mount in the Land of Origins, he could only rely on his legs to travel there.

Two hours later…

After entering the Land of Origins for four hours, a stone walls area that was covered with gray stone pillars finally appeared before Lu Yuan.

This was the Graystone Forest.

He couldn’t see the ends of this stone walls area. In one of the posts that he had read, it stated that a gene fighter had especially gone to measure the size of this area.

The Graystone Forest had a radius of close to 100 kilometers. It was absurd.

After taking in a deep breath, Lu Yuan took out one bottle of water to have a big drink and then ate some energy bars.

He had run all the way here and felt like he was going to be dried up by the sun.

After replenishing his stamina, Lu Yuan then stopped to rest for a bit before entering the Graystone Forest.

Not long after entering the Graystone Forest, Lu Yuan heard the sound of fighting in front.

He saw two catfolks, one holding a longsword and the other holding bow and arrows, attacking a graystone beetle that was the size of a small dog.

There were five to six other graystone beetles’ corpses on the ground.

The catfolk with the bow and arrows had great archery skills and when they shot, the arrows were like a stream of light, entering the graystone beetle’s eye.

It was an instant kill.

Lu Yuan’s pupils couldn’t help but contract.

There weren’t many precious resources in this area, so experts definitely wouldn’t come here.

Because of that, those who came here were mostly gene fighters who hadn’t awakened for long and didn’t have the capabilities to explore other areas.

Despite this, there was still a difference in their strength.

Lu Yuan felt that he might not be able to win against that archer even if they were to go one-on-one.

As expected, he was still a newbie and had to continue to work hard!

Lu Yuan cheered himself on and then quietly left.

This wasn’t the city and fighting wasn’t prohibited. Even those from the same race might fight each other, let alone those from different races.

It’d be a huge loss if he were to die.

For security purposes, Lu Yuan moved in a direction where there weren’t any sounds of fighting.

After another 20 or more minutes, his surroundings became very quiet.

Just then, Lu Yuan saw a graystone beetle under a stone pillar in front of him. Its huge mouth was chewing on rocks.

It was crunching away, looking like it was enjoying its food.

Lu Yuan looked at the surroundings and his eyes lit up.

He didn’t expect to encounter a graystone beetle that was alone by itself. This was great!
